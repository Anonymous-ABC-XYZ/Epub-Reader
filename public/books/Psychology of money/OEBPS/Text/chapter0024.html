		<p class="calibre6">Like all books, The Psychology of Money wouldn’t have been possible without the help of countless people who helped me along the way. There are too many to list them all. But a few who have been particularly supportive:</p>
		<p class="style1">Brian Richards, who bet on me before anyone else.</p>
		<p class="style1">Craig Shapiro, who bet on me when he didn’t have to.</p>
		<p class="style1">Gretchen Housel, whose support is unwavering.</p>
		<p class="style1">Jenna Abdou, who helps while asking for nothing in return.</p>
		<p class="style1">Craig Pearce, who encourages, guides, and grounds me.</p>
		<p class="calibre6">Jamie Catherwood, Josh Brown, Brent Beshore, Barry Ritholtz, Ben Carlson, Chris Hill, Michael Batnick, James Osorne, whose feedback is invaluable.</p>
		<p class="calibre6">Thank you.</p>
