			<p class="para-pf dropcaps3line char-dropcap">Wha…What?” says Mulaghesh. “<i class="char-i">Shot</i> you?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes, by all damned things, shot me!” snarls Thinadeshi. Her voice and accent are unusual: Mulaghesh realizes she’s speaking with a dialect and manner that hasn’t been used in over fifty years. “I go out of my way and nearly kill myself trying to avoid <i class="char-i">unspeakable</i> catastrophe, only to have some wild woman on a hilltop take out her little cannon and <i class="char-i">shoot</i> me! Of all the madness! Of all the ridiculous nonsense! And what are you here for now? Are you here to finish the job? You’re a committed assassin, I’ll grant you that! What in damned creation could have happened in the Saypuri Isles to send someone like <i class="char-i">you</i> after me?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh feels dizzy. It’s taking up a lot of her brainpower to accept the idea that not only is she standing here talking to one of the founding figures of Saypur, but this particular founding figure is yelling at her with a lot of vitriol. Eventually Mulaghesh’s brain kicks in and she manages to process what Thinadeshi is saying: <i class="char-i">Wild woman on a hilltop…Does she mean when the mines collapsed?</i></p>
			<p class="indent">“But, uh, I didn’t shoot you, ma’am,” says Mulaghesh. “If I’m understanding what you’re describing, ma’am—and I’m not at all convinced that I am—I shot at Voortya. The, uh, Divinity.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_373" epub:type="pagebreak" title="373"></span>Thinadeshi’s stare could punch a hole in the side of a battleship. She holds her arms out—well, one of them, at least, as her left isn’t particularly mobile. “Do you not see how I am attired? Does it not look <i class="char-i">familiar</i> to you? I can tell by your egregious accent that it is deeply unlikely that you have had much education, but is putting two and two together <i class="char-i">so</i> far beyond your grasp?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Are you…Are you saying that <i class="char-i">you’re</i> Voortya? The Divinity?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thinadeshi sighs and rolls her eyes. “Oh, by all that is…<i class="char-i">No</i>. I am saying that when I exercise the powers of this place, it projects an image tha<i class="char-i">aaah!</i>” She trails off as she’s racked with pain. Another dribble of blood comes leaking out from under her plate mail. “Damn you!” cries Thinadeshi. “Perhaps you’ve murdered me already! Am I poisoned?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Uh, I don’t think so,” says Mulaghesh. She undoes the clasp on her rifling and sets it aside. “And listen, I don’t understand a thing about what’s going on, but I know how to treat a bullet wound. I’ve brought a med kit, and I can be decent enough with it, even one-handed.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thinadeshi frowns at her, suspicious. “You’re quite sure you’re <i class="char-i">not</i> here to kill me?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“No. I’m here to stop <i class="char-i">that</i> from happening.” She points out the tower window to the sea of Voortyashtani sentinels beyond. “By any means necessary. I had no idea you were even here.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thinadeshi’s face softens a bit at that. She swallows. Mulaghesh can tell she’s quite weak. “W-Well. You’ve got quite a task ahead of you, now don’t you.” Then her eyes dim and she begins to topple over. Mulaghesh darts forward and grabs her before she strikes the ground.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div class="transition" aria-hidden="true">—</div>
			<p>Twenty minutes later Mulaghesh has the left arm of Thinadeshi’s armor pried off and has cut away her leather sleeve below. “It’ll reappear within a few hours,” Thinadeshi mutters. “All my vestments return to me, over time. I’ve tried taking them off, trust me.” Mulaghesh ignores her. There’s no bed in these chambers, just a giant marble chair about three times too big for a human being, so she has propped her up in that while she goes to work on her shoulder.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_374" epub:type="pagebreak" title="374"></span>There were three opiate shots in her med kit, tiny little syringes not much bigger than your thumbnail, and Mulaghesh dosed Thinadeshi up with one. Thinadeshi hardly makes a peep as Mulaghesh digs in the wound with a pair of tweezers. Mulaghesh can feel the bullet lodged up against Thinadeshi’s upper humerus, and it doesn’t seem to have shattered or split any, which is good. <i class="char-i">So maybe I won’t have to go back,</i> she thinks, <i class="char-i">and tell everyone this grand historical figure has died again, and this time</i> I <i class="char-i">killed her</i>.</p>
			<p class="indent">“Who are you?” asks Thinadeshi groggily. “What’s your name? You never told me.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh chews her lip as she delicately explores Thinadeshi’s wound. “I’m Turyin Mulaghesh, General Fourth Class of the Saypuri Military.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Military? So the Saypuri Isles still exist as a nation? It’s still solvent?” She sounds surprised, but then she would be: her stretch of history was incredibly rocky, with the global economy still in a nascent state.</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yeah, but they dropped the ‘Isles’ part a while ago,” says Mulaghesh. “Mostly because Saypur kept folding in regions that weren’t islands. Or maybe they just wanted a cleaner-looking letterhead.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I see.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh can feel her tense up, and knows what question she’s about to ask.</p>
			<p class="indent">“So,” says Thinadeshi. “What…year is it there?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh glances at her. “Why?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Don’t humor me, General. When I saw the men in the mines I could tell things were different. I’ve been gone far longer than I thought, haven’t I?”</p>
			<p class="indent"><i class="char-i">Men in the mines?</i> “Yeah. Yeah, I’d say so. Hold still.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_375" epub:type="pagebreak" title="375"></span>Then, faintly: “Tell me, and be honest…are my children dead?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh pauses as she works. She can feel the bullet coming loose, but she still feels obligated to answer this question. “I know one of them is still in government. Padwal.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Padwal?” says Thinadeshi, sounding surprised. “In <i class="char-i">government</i>?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yeah. He’s an MP.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“A what?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“A minister of Parliament.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Parliament…,” says Thinadeshi. “We’ve kept <i class="char-i">that</i>? Did <i class="char-i">no one</i> read my plans to select a proportionate amount of representatives from each region to vote on each issue?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Uh…I don’t know, ma’am,” says Mulaghesh. “I’m a soldier, not a scholar.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“It was a very thorough treatise, I thought,” says Thinadeshi, gritting her teeth as Mulaghesh wriggles the bullet. “What about Kristappa? And Rodmal? What about them?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I’m afraid I don’t know, ma’am.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“You don’t know if they’re alive?” she asks, heartbroken.</p>
			<p class="indent">“No. I’m sorry. I don’t.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“But how old would they be today? If they are alive, I mean.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh pauses, uncertain how to word this. “You’ve been gone over sixty years.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thinadeshi sits up. “Over <i class="char-i">sixty</i>?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Um. Yeah. I think the exact number is sixty-four.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Sixty-four <i class="char-i">years</i>?” She stares out the window, aghast. “Oh, my word…I…I suppose it’s…it’s fairly unlikely that they are alive, then.” Her voice is frail and crushed. “After all, Padwal was one of the youngest. What a curiously dispiriting thing it is, to outlive one’s children. If this strange state could even be called living. And I didn’t even get to know they died.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh readjusts the tweezers. “Can you hold still? I’m about to get this thing out of you.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Ah…Ah! Please hurry!”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I’m going!” says Mulaghesh. “I got it, I got it…” Then, finally, the chunk of metal comes loose, sliding out of the wound. “There.” She flicks it out the window without a thought, then applies bandages to the wound. “I’m going to need your help to stitch this up, though. I can’t manage that one-handed. Think you can assist?”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_376" epub:type="pagebreak" title="376"></span>Thinadeshi’s face is wan. “You ask much of an old woman.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“We can wait a bit and then try again.”</p>
			<p class="indent">She sighs. “Oh, no. Don’t bother. My shoulder is not the most important thing right now. And besides, I shall be gone quite soon, I imagine.”</p>
			<p class="indent">There’s an awkward pause.</p>
			<p class="indent">“Huh?” says Mulaghesh. “This isn’t a fatal wound by any means. Unless you’ve got a condition or something.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“A condition…yes. I have exactly that.” She sighs again and shuts her eyes. “I won’t perish from any wound to my body, my mortal self. They’re killing me out there, don’t you see? All those souls out there. They’re pulling me apart.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“What do you mean?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Here. Look. Help me take off my right glove.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh does so. Then Thinadeshi holds her hand up to the window. “Watch.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Okay…” Mulaghesh crouches beside her, not sure what she’s watching: Thinadeshi’s hand is small, well-manicured, but otherwise unremarkable.</p>
			<p class="indent">But then…</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh sees it, very faintly: the outline of the window frame <i class="char-i">through</i> Thinadeshi’s hand, as if her flesh is very slightly translucent.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh says, “What in all the hells…?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“You see it, then,” says Thinadeshi grimly. “My…I don’t know, my <i class="char-i">corporeal</i> essence is fading. I’m not supposed to be here, so this place is steadily asserting that I’m <i class="char-i">not</i> here. No mortal was ever intended to shoulder the burdens of a Divinity.” She puts back on her glove. “I am being rejected, slowly but surely. But I’ve known I’ve been losing this battle for some time.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh holds down the bandages on Thinadeshi’s shoulder, which is still seeping blood. “Can I ask <i class="char-i">how</i> you came to be here? Or, really…what’s going on?”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_377" epub:type="pagebreak" title="377"></span>“I suppose in the normal world everyone assumes I just disappeared.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“That’s about the cut of it.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“But I didn’t, obviously. I have chosen to remain here, in this place, since I left the world I knew.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“You <i class="char-i">chose</i> to come here?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Oh, no, I didn’t choose to <i class="char-i">come</i>. But I chose to <i class="char-i">stay</i> once I realized the consequences if I left.” She sighs and rubs her eyes, exhausted. “What’s the last you know about me?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I know you vanished in Voortyashtan. That’s all anyone knows.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes…I was on an exploratory mission, trying to find a rail passage out to the wildernesses, along the Solda to the coast, so we could try to bring it under control. We saw bandit kings and pestilence and warfare and mass rape. There was no leadership, no control after the Blink. And the Blink struck this place quite hard. I remember coming here, seeing the squalor and the vandals, fighting off attackers nearly every day and night. I was brazen, you see. And…reckless. I had just lost Shomal.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh remembers this from her history books: Thinadeshi’s four-year-old son, lost to plague during her travels on the Continent. “I see.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I was willing to fight everyone and everything, after that,” says Thinadeshi quietly. “I was going to win or die trying, and…and I didn’t prefer which, honestly. But then one day we made it. We passed through the ranges and came to the ocean. But the question was, what was the easiest route? What was the best way to link the North Seas to Saypur? So we had to survey. And one morning I was walking along the coast, taking measurements of possible passages back through the ranges…and then I came upon it.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thinadeshi’s words are growing slurred now: the opiates must be sloshing around in her system. “The Blink did a lot of damage to the Voortyashtani coast. So much of what they built was on the sea, so many miracles worked into the cliffs and the shore, and the Blink was so recent then. It was like chaos, unimaginable devastation. Homes and bridges and rubble all piled up on the bottom of the cliffs. And some of the cliffs had cracked <i class="char-i">open</i>, like an egg. And I came to one of these cracks, and I looked in”—her face fills with an awful dread—“and they saw me, and they <i class="char-i">called</i> <i class="char-i">up</i> to me.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_378" epub:type="pagebreak" title="378"></span>Thinadeshi’s horrified expression sets a chill in Mulaghesh’s belly. “Who? Who did?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“The soldiers,” says Thinadeshi softly. “All the Voortyashtani soldiers. <i class="char-i">Ever</i>. They were waiting for me in that cliff. It was a tomb, you see. A massive tomb, bigger than anything I’d ever seen. But the Voortyashtanis had a very strange way of memorializing their dead.” She looks at Mulaghesh, wild-eyed. “You know about their swords? That the two bond, with each becoming a vessel for the other, the body carrying the sword and the sword carrying the soul?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I’m familiar with it,” says Mulaghesh.</p>
			<p class="indent">“That’s what was down there,” says Thinadeshi. Her eyes are wide with awe. “All those swords. Thousands of them. <i class="char-i">Millions</i> of them. All with <i class="char-i">minds</i> in them, all with agency, memories of lives and inconceivable bloodshed, and all of them crying out to me.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh remembers the reports of Choudhry searching the hills for a mythical tomb…but she never imagined that it was like this. “So the tomb wasn’t full of bodies, but full of <i class="char-i">swords</i>?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes. Voortyashtanis didn’t consider there to be a difference between the two. Sentinels fashioned their lives to be weapons, their bodies and minds to be instruments of warfare—their swords were a part of that, perhaps the heart of what they became. That’s why they call this place the City of Blades, after all. And when I found them, there were so many of them, exposed to the sky, spilling out into the sea, all of them screaming out to someone to find them, to help them.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“But how were they still alive? How did they still <i class="char-i">exist</i>? They were Divine, right? How could they exist without Voortya?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Because Voortya had made a pact with them,” says Thinadeshi wearily. “It was an agreement: they would make themselves into weapons, be her warriors and go to war for her, and she would give them eternal life. And this contract was so binding that it <i class="char-i">had</i> to be executed—even if Voortya wasn’t there! Her death did not, to use the terminology, render <i class="char-i">any</i>thing null and void! The dead were <i class="char-i">still</i> supposed to get their afterlife. They were <i class="char-i">still</i> supposed to reside with Voortya in the City of Blades. And one day, they were <i class="char-i">still</i> supposed to return to where their swords lay in the mortal world and begin the last war, the final war that would consume all of creation. This is what was promised them, and the dead, in essence, intend to see that the bargain is fulfilled. If it was only one or two departed souls, their power might be negligible—but there are <i class="char-i">millions</i> here with me in the City of Blades. With their strength pooled they’re able to make sure reality holds up its part of the bargain. They are <i class="char-i">insisting</i> that they be remembered, and any Divine construction created to remember them is therefore forced to persist.” Suddenly she looks terribly, terribly weary. “But they needed Voortya herself in order for the agreement to be executed. Some part of her had to reside with them in the City of Blades. Or someone quite similar, I should say.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_379" epub:type="pagebreak" title="379"></span>Mulaghesh slowly realizes what she means. “<i class="char-i">You?</i>” she asks, horrified. “They wanted <i class="char-i">you</i> to stand in for Voortya?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thinadeshi smiles weakly. “They needed the Maiden of Steel, Queen of Grief, Empress of Graves, She Who Clove the Earth in Twain, Devourer of Children. Am I not all these things, to some extent? I devoted my life to the railroads, to reconstruction, so I am the Maiden of Steel. I’ve torn apart mountains to build them, so I am She Who Clove the Earth in Twain. Hundreds of laborers died fulfilling my dangerous dream, so I am the Empress of Graves. And…my own children perished in my endeavors. My family suffered unspeakably for everything I wrought. So I am also Queen of Grief, and Devourer of Children. Perhaps it was my punishment to become this thing. Perhaps I deserve this. Whatever the case, they needed someone who matched their <i class="char-i">idea</i> of Voortya—and I came close enough to count. There was a vacuum, and I merely filled it.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“But why did you consent?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Because when they spoke to me,” says Thinadeshi, “when they reached out to me and begged me to take up the mantle of their mother, I understood that their true hope was that I would allow them their last war. Their final great battle, the one they’d been promised for centuries. And I could not allow that. I could not allow them to make war upon my country, not after it had just been freed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_380" epub:type="pagebreak" title="380"></span>“So I climbed down to them. And as I did, the world…changed. The skies grew dark. The stars changed—they became older, stranger. And the farther I climbed down the broken cliff to them, the more the world shifted and churned until I was walking down a white staircase, and then I was in a grand, white courtyard with many passageways and staircases up—and the voices asked me to climb up, up, and I did. I climbed and I climbed until I came to the top of the tower, and there was the great, awful red throne, and beside it…Beside it was this.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thinadeshi closes her eyes once more, and concentrates. She reaches out with her right hand, appearing to sift through the empty air before her. Then her fingers clench around something, and she pulls out…</p>
			<p class="indent">Suddenly there is a sword in her hand, or rather a sword hilt, as the blade is but a faint flicker of golden light. Mulaghesh can’t tell exactly where it came from: it feels as if it’s <i class="char-i">always</i> been in her hand, but Thinadeshi simply chose to make it visible now.</p>
			<p class="indent">The hilt and handle are strange to Mulaghesh’s eyes: at first it appears to be made of some dark, viscous black material, like volcanic glass. But then the light shifts, and the hilt isn’t dark stone, but a severed hand. Its blackened fingers clutch the bottom of the formless blade, its thumb and forefinger crooked in such a manner that Mulaghesh knows it was not made by any artist.</p>
			<p class="indent">The more she looks at the sword the more she perceives many things in it, even sensations: the sound of steel on steel, the sight of distant flames, the rumble of horses’ hooves. The sword flickers back and forth between being made of stone and fire and steel and lightning before, finally, becoming a human hand once more. And as she looks she knows that this is no mere sculpture: the hand is real, sacrificed by a man long ago to his Divinity, and through the sacrifice of his son she became exceedingly powerful, and this sacrifice was memorialized on stones and books and pieces of armor, the hand clutching the blade, the sacrifice paired with assault.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_381" epub:type="pagebreak" title="381"></span>“The sword of Voortya,” says Thinadeshi quietly. “It is with me always now. Just like the sentinels and their own weapons, it is a part of me. It whispers to me, telling me I am Voortya, telling me what I must do, playing with my thoughts. It is damnably hard to resist sometimes. For long stretches, I think I <i class="char-i">am</i> Voortya, sometimes.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“That sounds dangerous,” says Mulaghesh.</p>
			<p class="indent">“You’ve no idea. I think it is not the true thing, or at least not as it was: like the City of Blades, like everything Divine, it is but a shadow of its former self. But that is still more dangerous and more powerful than any device any mortal has ever wielded. One day I will be rid of it. Perhaps soon.” Thinadeshi sits back as if the effort of producing the weapon exhausted her. “When I took up the sword of Voortya, in the eyes of the dead, it was as if I <i class="char-i">was</i> her. And because she’d granted them power, they then bestowed it upon <i class="char-i">me</i>. I was given limited abilities, both within this ghostly realm and beyond. And one of those powers was to enter the land of the living, and destroy. Which I did.</p>
			<p class="indent">“I crossed over, and I attacked the cliffs with all the power that was granted to me. I brought down the tomb, I pummeled the earth, I hacked at it again and again with the sword of Voortya. The effort exhausted me—in retrospect, it nearly killed me, for I had done something only a Divinity should be able to do—but I did it.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Why?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“They wished to return to where their swords lay—but what if there were no swords? What could they do then? The blades act as beacons, you see, tying the land of the dead to the land of the living. By destroying them I cut the strings and set this island adrift, existing in a half-real state. I was marooned here with them, dressed up as their dead god, but at least the world was safe. At least my people were safe. At least my children could finally go on to live happy, safe lives.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“How have you stayed alive all this time?” asks Mulaghesh. “I don’t see any food or water around here.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I’ve wondered that myself,” says Thinadeshi. “But I never get hungry here, or thirsty. My suspicion is that this place is some kind of a limbo, really. When Voortya died, it stopped being completely real…and when I destroyed the swords, and destroyed the last final link to mortal life with them, it became even less real than that. Time doesn’t work here, or if it does, it doesn’t work the way it should.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_382" epub:type="pagebreak" title="382"></span>Thinadeshi is silent for a long, long time. She draws a rattling breath. “But then,” she croaks. “But then, but then, but then…I felt it. I felt it out there in the land of the living. Somehow we were being pulled back. Someone had found the tomb, or what was left of it. Someone had found the swords. And they began meddling i—”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh sits upright, every muscle in her body clenched to the point of straining. “Son of a bitch! Son of a damned <i class="char-i">bitch</i>!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thinadeshi draws away from her, alarmed. “What? What is it? What’s wrong with you?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“It’s the thinadeskite!” cries Mulaghesh.</p>
			<p class="indent">“The what?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“The thinadeskite! It’s not some naturally occurring ore! <i class="char-i">It’s what’s left of their damned swords!</i>”</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div class="transition" aria-hidden="true">—</div>
			<p>“Thina…deskite?” asks Thinadeshi. “What do you mean?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“It’s this ore,” says Mulaghesh. “Or that’s what they thought it was, discovered outside of Fort Thin…” She pauses as she realizes nearly everything she’s about to reference has been named for the ill-looking person sitting before her. “Never mind. But they thought it was this natural resource with some unusual properties, so they started digging it up. But it wasn’t natural at all; it was what was left of the swords after you obliterated the tomb, pulverized it beyond recognition! That must have been why Choudhry was so interested in the geomorphological history of the cliffs: she could <i class="char-i">tell</i> that something was wrong! She must have noticed some sign of the damage you did, and known that it couldn’t possibly have been some natural effect!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thinadeshi looks at her side-eyed. “I won’t pretend to know anything about a lick of what you’re saying here, but do go on.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh scratches her scalp, excited and anxious. “<i class="char-i">And</i> that must be why the ore never tested as Divine! Because it <i class="char-i">isn’t</i> the will of a Divinity that makes it work—it’s the will of the dead! If you’re right, and anything that memorializes the dead is <i class="char-i">forced</i> to persist, then that would explain everything—why the man atop the Tooth was still alive, why the ‘tribute’ statues they hauled up from the bottom of the sea are still around, and why any miracle relating to the dead still functions! And that’s why I had flashbacks down in the mine’s tunnels—I was literally walking through a sea of souls and memories.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_383" epub:type="pagebreak" title="383"></span>“I will assume you are talking about the mine I destroyed,” says Thinadeshi.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh stops. “Oh. That’s right. That was you, after all.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes,” says Thinadeshi, nettled. “This was the incident in which you shot me, if you remember.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Which was pretty damned justified, if I might say so! From my end you looked a damn sight like the real thing!”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Of course I did!” snaps Thinadeshi. “When one wields even a shadow of a Divinity’s power, that power tends to follow decorum and clothe one correctly!”</p>
			<p class="indent">“What, it even makes you a hundred sizes bigger?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“It’s all a play of images and perception, a warping of the world! Miracles are apparently very formal things, I’ll have you know!” She winces as Mulaghesh tends to her shoulder. “But they do <i class="char-i">not</i> make one invulnerable.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“How was it that no one else saw you?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Because I did not wish them to,” says Thinadeshi. “I tapped the sword’s strength to veil myself from the land of the living. But…when I climbed the cliff, the sword <i class="char-i">bucked,</i> like a dowsing rod sensing water. Something was wrong. Perhaps it sensed you—maybe it sensed some quality in you it found familiar, or even desirable. Why hide one’s self from a kindred spirit?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh is silent as she considers the awful implications of this. Finally she asks, “How did you know about the mine?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Because someone opened a window into it,” says Thinadeshi. “I felt someone trying to open many entryways into this place. I didn’t know that was one of the things I could do—sensing such a thing—but apparently I can. They tried it over and over again. I went to investigate, fearing someone could, I don’t know, incite or awaken all the souls here. Then I came across a gap hanging in the air, a mirror or window into…somewhere else. A tunnel of some kind, and in that tunnel were some grubby little men. They did not see me, and I listened to them talking, digging down in the dirt and hauling up all the fragments of the very things I’d hoped I’d destroyed long ago. I thought that this might be the reason the City of Blades was being pulled back, reconnecting with the land of the living. So I did what was necessary.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_384" epub:type="pagebreak" title="384"></span>“And you destroyed it,” says Mulaghesh. She doesn’t bother telling Thinadeshi that she killed three soldiers in the process of doing so. What good would that do?</p>
			<p class="para-p-alt1">“But it didn’t work,” says Thinadeshi miserably. “I can still feel us growing closer and closer. It made me so weak, to do it, but it accomplished nothing. The dead remember more and more of what was promised to them. Something has happened in Voortyashtan, and it acts like a faint light to a blind man, and they are following it, feeling their way back to the land of the living, and what they are owed. What were you people <i class="char-i">doing</i> with that mine, anyway?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh summarizes what little she understands about the wide-ranging qualities of thinadeskite. Thinadeshi is absolutely horrified. “And they named it after <i class="char-i">me</i>?” she says. “They named this hellish material after the person who tried to <i class="char-i">annihilate</i> it?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Well, they didn’t know that,” says Mulaghesh. “You’re well thought of, and they thought it could be world-changing….They said it would revolutionize nearly anything electrical.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Of course it would!” says Thinadeshi angrily. “If it can store a soul and all of its memories for hundreds of years, then a few photons are no issue at all! Every atom of those things is packed with the fury of millions of people denied what they felt was their due. I’ve no doubt that’s expressing itself in all manner of horrible ways!”</p>
			<p class="para-p-alt1">“But they’re not doing anything special with it,” says Mulaghesh. “They’re just making wire and other electrical material out of it. And if you’re telling me that destroying the mine didn’t stop anything…then it must have been something else that started this whole thing.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_385" epub:type="pagebreak" title="385"></span>“Then what?” says Thinadeshi. “What else could possibly be waking the dead?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh thinks back to that afternoon on the clifftops: tripping over the tunnel, finding Choudhry’s letter describing a mysterious person infiltrating the thinadeskite mines…</p>
			<p class="indent">“What if…What if it’s not just messing around with the ore that does it? You said yourself that the dead wouldn’t accept just anyone as Voortya, they needed someone that was…I don’t know, the right <i class="char-i">shape</i>. The right <i class="char-i">clothes.</i>”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“So the right shape for the thinadeski—”</p>
			<p class="indent">“<i class="char-i">Please</i> stop calling it that.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“All right! The right shape for the ore…would be a sword.” She looks at Thinadeshi. “Would it be possible for someone to forge <i class="char-i">new</i> swords out of the ore?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I…I suppose,” says Thinadeshi. “But how would one know how to do it? How would one even know what to make? I made sure no examples of Voortyashtani swords remained in the living world.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“No, you just destroyed that one tomb,” says Mulaghesh. “Special saints got tombs of their own. Ones that I guess contained <i class="char-i">only</i> their swords. We found one in the Teeth of the World, one that didn’t have a sword in it. Unless someone had already been there and taken it—”</p>
			<p class="indent">“—so they could use it as an original,” says Thinadeshi, “and use it to make copies. But they would need to have extensive smithing knowledge for that to work.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh cocks her head, thinking. Then time seems to slow down for her.</p>
			<p class="indent">She remembers walking into a house, noting how cold it was…but then as she left, turning around and seeing a thick tumble of smoke from the chimney.</p>
			<p class="indent">A voice in her head: <i class="char-i">Have you ever heard of Saint Petrenko?</i></p>
			<p class="indent">And then the words of the Watcher: <i class="char-i">It was Petrenko who developed the method that the old ones first used to make their swords.</i></p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_386" epub:type="pagebreak" title="386"></span>“I think I know who it is,” says Mulaghesh softly. “But damned if I know why.” She looks at Thinadeshi. “Can you leave with me? Do you have enough strength for that?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thinadeshi laughs hollowly. “If I leave, they leave.” She nods out the window. “I’m the only thing keeping them back. Even as you’re talking to me now, I’m fighting a war here.” She taps the side of her head. “It’s killing me. Destroying the mine weakened me terribly. But I have to keep fighting them, telling them not yet, not yet….So I can’t go, General. More so, I won’t.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh and Thinadeshi exchange a silent moment then: the two women look at each other, each hard-eyed and determined, and Mulaghesh understands right away that to try to convince Thinadeshi to leave her post would be a waste of time. Her mind’s made up, and Mulaghesh can respect that.</p>
			<p class="indent">“How much time do you have?” asks Mulaghesh.</p>
			<p class="indent">Thinadeshi looks relieved they’re moving on. “Not much. The closer we get to the land of the living, the more the sentinels awake. It’s getting harder and harder.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I <i class="char-i">would</i> propose that I go back to Voortyashtan, find the swords, and destroy them,” says Mulaghesh. “But what happens if you die before I do that?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Then they invade,” says Thinadeshi. “And you die.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Shit,” says Mulaghesh. She rubs her mouth, frustrated. “So there’s no Plan B? No backup option?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Thinadeshi is quiet. Then she slowly looks at the sword in her hand. “There is…one option.” She holds it out to Mulaghesh, her face grim. “You can take this.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“What? <i class="char-i">Me</i> take the sword of Voortya? What the hells are you talking about? Won’t that kill you?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I’m already being killed,” says Thinadeshi. “This strange device won’t keep me alive much longer. And it will take some time for its powers to depart from me: in essence, it will take time for this place to realize I’ve dropped the act. Probably no longer than the time I have <i class="char-i">with</i> the sword. You can take it, in case you fail.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“And what in the hells am I supposed to do with it?”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_387" epub:type="pagebreak" title="387"></span>“It’s a token,” says Thinadeshi, “a symbol. It can be unlocked, unfolded, interpreted to be many things. You can do many deeds with it if you use it the right way, if you <i class="char-i">think</i> about it the right way. Voortya was the goddess of warfare, General. And you of all people should know that war is an art requiring decorum and formality. It feverishly adheres to rules and traditions—and that can be used against it. Take it!”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh reaches out hesitantly, then takes the black, severed hand from Thinadeshi’s grasp. Instantly the faint sword blade vanishes, and Mulaghesh is left holding a heavy black sword handle with a rather curious crossguard, and nothing more: there is no suggestion of fingers or flesh in it, no flash of lightning, no lick of flame. It is just a thing, not a Divine conceit made solid.</p>
			<p class="indent">“That all sounds like a bunch of variations on ‘I don’t know’ to me,” says Mulaghesh.</p>
			<p class="indent">“It responds to different people in different ways,” says Thinadeshi. “And the dead still believe me to be Voortya. Once I am gone, it will awaken to you—but I am not sure how. And I would prefer we not have to depend on that at all.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Me neither,” says Mulaghesh. “So how do I get out of this place?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I can push you back,” says Thinadeshi. “That will not sap my strength much, or so I hope.” She shuts her eyes. “I see an entryway—a doorway in the water. My face looks down on it. No, no…It’s Voortya’s face, of course. There is a young woman there, waiting.” She opens her eyes. “Is that safe? Should she be there?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Was she blond and kind of unbearable-looking?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“She was blond, yes. And she did have a…a <i class="char-i">combative</i> look to her….”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Then that’s fine.” She gathers up her gear. “Can you just…do it now?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I can,” says Thinadeshi. She reaches out to Mulaghesh, then hesitates. “I suppose this would be my last chance to ask how the world has gotten along without me, wouldn’t it?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yeah. Is there anything you want me to say or do?” says Mulaghesh. “Anything you want me to tell your family?”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_388" epub:type="pagebreak" title="388"></span>Since Mulaghesh first saw Thinadeshi she’s always had a hard look in her eye, as if her soul is an anvil and she expects the whole of the world to be shaped on it; but at this question the barest crack begins to show, and she trembles a little. “I think…I think it would be best to think that I <i class="char-i">did</i> die all those years ago. I did leave the land of the living, after all. Is that not death? But I think I chose this before then. When I chose to travel to the Continent and take my children with me…When I chose accomplishment over my responsibilities…I look back on all I did, all I got done, and they fill me with nothing at all. Not pride, not joy, not contentment. All I have now is this insatiable hunger.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Hunger for what?”</p>
			<p class="indent">She smiles faintly. “To tell my children that, despite everything, I loved them. And I wished I could have loved them more, showed them that more.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I’ll tell them, if I can find them,” says Mulaghesh.</p>
			<p class="indent">Thinadeshi’s face hardens. “Then go,” she says. “And get it done.” She taps Mulaghesh on the forehead, just barely pushing her off balance, and Mulaghesh falls backward, sure to strike the floor….</p>
			<p class="indent">…But she doesn’t. The floor isn’t there. Instead there are the still, cool, dark waters, and she’s plummeting down through them again, sinking faster and faster. The white citadel of the City of Blades shrinks above her, dwindling down until it’s a slice of light above her, and then it’s gone.</p>
			<p class="indent">She knows what’s going to happen this time, but it doesn’t make it any easier: again, the pressure builds and builds until it feels like her head is about to crack like an egg. She swears she can feel her ribs popping and creaking. She doesn’t struggle this time, but curls up into a ball. Then she feels gravity swirling around her, like the world can’t decide what’s up and what’s down, and when she opens her eyes she sees a dark black hole opening above her.</p>
			<p class="indent">She punches through, flailing wildly. Her arms strike the rim of the stone basin. She’s still blinking water out of her eyes, but she can see the canvas roof of the yard of statues above her.</p>
			<p class="indent">“Careful! Careful!” says Signe’s voice. Signe grabs her by her arms and hauls her out. She bounces roughly off of a stone edge below before both she and Signe topple over into the mud.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_389" epub:type="pagebreak" title="389"></span>“Good heavens,” says Signe. “What happened to you? Did you…Did you actually <i class="char-i">go</i> there? And why are you…well…<i class="char-i">red</i>?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh coughs up what feels like a liter of seawater again. “I know who it is,” she gasps. “I know who it is!”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Who…what is?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Mulaghesh rolls over and pulls herself up onto all fours. The bone-white faces of the statues stare at her expectantly.</p>
			<p class="indent">“It’s Rada Smolisk,” she says quietly. “Rada Smolisk is who’s waking up the dead.”</p>
