				<p class="para-fsqf">“A memorably surreal urbanscape…readers seeking a truly refreshing fantasy milieu should travel to Bulikov, and welcome its conquest.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—<i>New York Times Book Review</i></p>
				<p class="para-fsqf">“Entertaining yet thought-provoking…Entrancing characters, exciting descriptions and piercingly clear action keep the story moving swiftly and surely to a satisfying conclusion.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—<i>Seattle Times</i></p>
				<p class="para-fsqf">“A delightful urban fantasy that travels through a city full of Escher-like staircases and alternate realities.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—<i>Washington Post</i></p>
				<p class="para-fsqf">“[An] incredible journey through a wondrously weird and surprising world…I found myself both delighted and fascinated as every layer was slowly unpacked.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—Tor.com</p>
				<p class="para-fsqf">“Suddenly, the pages are whipping by, 50 at a clip as mysteries are uncovered, miracles happen and assassins begin scaling the walls….Bennett is plainly a writer in love with the world he has built—and with good cause.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—NPR.org</p>
				<p class="para-fsqf">“Smart and sardonic, with wry echoes from classic tales mixed up in an inventive, winning narrative. [Bennett is] a master of the genre.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—<i>Kirkus</i></p>

				<p class="para-fsqf">“Does everything a really good sequel should…if anything, it’s a better book than its predecessor. I was worried that by interrupting a run of superlative standalone stories to finesse a follow-up, Robert Jackson Bennett risked repeating himself. Being wrong has never felt so right.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—Tor.com</p>
				<p class="para-fsqf">“Does [<i>City of Blades</i>] live up to the Locus, World Fantasy, British Fantasy and GoodReads Choice Award nominated <i>City of Stairs</i>? Allow me to answer with an emphatic <i>yes</i>….Robert Jackson Bennett is one of the most talented authors writing in SFF today and this is his finest work to date.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—Fantasy Faction</p>
				<p class="para-fsqf">“<i>City of Stairs</i> worked, primarily, for one big reason: The world Bennett had created was just <i>awesome</i>. [<i>City of Blades</i>] feels no less rich, no less realized….Read this first and then, if you fall just as hard for the world as I have, go back and read <i>Stairs</i> to get your fill of all the strangeness and wonderment.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—NPR.org</p>
				<p class="para-fsqf">“Just as powerful as the first, and even stronger in significant ways…among the best novels of 2016.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—<i>SF Signal</i></p>
				<p class="para-fsqf">“Hooked me from the first chapter and kept me reading at a frantic pace. I can honestly say I enjoyed it even more than the first.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—<i>The Speculative Herald</i></p>
				<p class="para-fsqf">“Not only recaptures the flame of the first book, but also maybe burns a little brighter…I sincerely hope this will be a landmark trilogy that, like the deathblow to a Divinity, will have a rippling effect on the epic fantasy genre for years to come.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—<i>SFF World</i></p>
				<p class="para-fsqf">“Astonishingly good…a deep, powerful novel that’s worth reading and rereading.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred)</p>
				<p class="para-fsqf">“Building beautifully upon the richly detailed world introduced in the first book of the series, Bennett serves a stew of fantasy and adventure with a healthy dose of humor and a ladle full of violence.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—<i>Library Journal</i> (starred)</p>
				<p class="para-fsqf">“Richly detailed and expertly plotted. A grand entertainment.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—<i>Kirkus</i></p>
				<p class="para-fsqf">“Like the very best speculative fiction, <i>City of Blades</i> immerses readers in a made-up world, only to force us to take a harder look at the real one.”</p>
				<p class="para-fsqs">—<i>Booklist</i></p>
