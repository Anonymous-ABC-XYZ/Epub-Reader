			<p class="dropcaps3line char-dropcap">Malwina recoils as the figure comes shooting up to her, thinking it to be Nokov—but it isn’t. The way this new arrival moves is…strange. They flick across the skies like a bat, and it takes Malwina a moment to realize they’re dancing across the seconds, gracefully hopping from moment to moment—but they’re moments that haven’t <i>happened</i> yet. Which Malwina always thought was impossible. It’s antithetical to her very being.</p>
			<p class="indent">The figure leaps up and lands on the steps before her. It’s a girl, she sees, about her own age, and she looks…familiar.</p>
			<p class="indent">Malwina sits up. “T-Tatyana?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“No,” says the girl. She looks at Malwina, and Malwina sees her eyes have changed. They’re now queerly colorless, yet as she stares into them Malwina gets the strangest feeling: she can’t help but imagine that in this girl’s eyes she’s seeing all the things that will happen in the next few moments.</p>
			<p class="indent">Malwina watches what she sees in the girl’s eyes. Then she gasps and looks away, horrified.</p>
			<p class="indent">“You know me, Tulvos,” says the girl slowly. “You know me, daughter of the past. Don’t you?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I…Yes,” says Malwina reluctantly. “Yes. I…I think I do.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The girl’s face is fierce and terrible. “<i>Say it</i>. Say my name.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“You’re…You’re the future, aren’t you?” says Malwina. “I am the daughter of the things that have been. And you are the daughter of the things that will be.” Malwina shuts her eyes, and slowly understands she knows this girl’s name. “You…You’re <i>Alvos</i>, aren’t you?”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_414" epub:type="pagebreak" title="414"></span>The girl nods. “You remember now. So do I, finally. That was what they named me. But I am more than that. As are you.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“What?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Don’t you remember yet, Tulvos? They made us so that each would always repel the other, and we could never be in the same place at the same time….And now I know why. Because they knew that if we got too close, we would remember. Now that I am myself, now that I am close to you, I remember everything.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Remember…what?” asks Malwina.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alvos steps closer. “You don’t remember because you don’t <i>want</i> to remember. Do you recall the last time you saw your mother? Your true mother—Olvos. Do you remember?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“What in hells does it matter to you?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“You were young,” says Alvos. “Very young, in the forest, at night…Olvos was there. She was weeping. And the other Divinities were there, all six in one place. And they took you, and led you away from her, to the darkness….”</p>
			<p class="indent">Malwina’s eyes widen. “How do you <i>know</i> that?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Because I have this same memory,” says Alvos. “Because it <i>is</i> the same memory.” She crouches to look into her face. “Because at that time we were not two people, but <i>one</i>.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Malwina stares at her for a long time. Then she whispers, “No…”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Do you remember our name?” asks Alvos. “The name of the person we used to be?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Malwina shuts her eyes. “Stop. Please stop talking.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I do,” says Alvos quietly. “We were <i>Sempros</i>. Past and future melded together. Time itself. All things that have been, all things that will be, and all things that are, in one being, one mind.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“No.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Listen to me, Tulvos. Haven’t you always felt a curious hollowness in you, as if some part of you was empty, or incomplete?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“No!”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_415" epub:type="pagebreak" title="415"></span>“Do you remember what they did to us? How they split us, tore us apart? Maimed us and remade us in the darkness as we wept and struggled?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Stop it!”</p>
			<p class="indent">“They changed our memories,” says Alvos. “Broke us open and reshaped our personalities….Do you remember our father, Taalhavras, saying that it had to be done, and it had to be done while we were young, and weak? How if we grew up and grew too strong, none of them could resist us?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Malwina buries her face in her hands, weeping.</p>
			<p class="indent">“Taalhavras,” says Alvos. “And Kolkan. And Ahanas. And Jukov, and Voortya. And Olvos, our mother…She just wept. Wept and watched. Watched as they brutalized her child, all so that they could rule unthreatened….”</p>
			<p class="indent">“What do you want?” shouts Malwina. “What do you want from me?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Alvos sticks out her hand, her face grim. Malwina stares at it for a moment before she realizes what she’s suggesting.</p>
			<p class="indent">“No,” says Malwina softly.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alvos’s stare is fierce, but her cheeks are wet with tears. “You know you must.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“No, I won’t….I won’t do that, not <i>that</i>.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“It wasn’t right, what they did to us,” says Alvos. “It wasn’t right, what Jukov did to us. Wasn’t right that we lived and loved as mortals, and then lost those that we loved so dearly. Me, my mother, Shara…And you, Tavaan. None of this was right. These people, they keep hurting us, taking things from us…And now we can do something. Take my hand. Take my hand, and become one again with me.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“And then do what?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Fix this,” says Alvos. Her face is a mask of grief and despair. “Fix what has been done to us.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“You sound like Nokov.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Take my hand,” says Alvos, “and we can defeat him. No one else can. That’s why they cut us in two, because together we could grow stronger than all the gods combined. Don’t you remember why they feared us so?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Malwina bows her head. “Because…Because all things are subservient to time.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_416" epub:type="pagebreak" title="416"></span>“Yes,” whispers Alvos. “<i>Yes</i>. All these plots, all these schemes. See what sort of world the powerful few have built. See how they fought to retain that world. So much pain, so much sorrow, all so they could rule for a handful more years.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“And what would you do about that?” asks Malwina.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alvos leans close. “I would wipe it clean,” she says savagely. “Wipe away all that sorrow, all that pain, all that <i>history</i>, and start over again.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Malwina sits in silence.</p>
			<p class="indent">“The only way to truly clean a slate,” Alvos says, “is with blood. Many have tried to convince me otherwise. But now I know it is true.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Malwina slowly turns to look out at Bulikov below. She sees that the world has recognized the two of them coming together: as the past and future grow close, the present is unsure how to advance, and simply waits. She can see Nokov suspended in the air below them, his face twisted in fear and fury.</p>
			<p class="indent">She likes it. She likes seeing him afraid and weak. After what he did to Tavaan and the other children, this sight is maybe the one last thing she could enjoy.</p>
			<p class="indent">“He deserves it, doesn’t he?” she says quietly.</p>
			<p class="indent">“Yes,” says Alvos. “He took away my mother. He took away the love of your life. And all because he was angry and frightened. He deserves it. And we deserved none of this pain. No one in this world has deserved any of the pain that it has brought them. No one.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Malwina turns to look at Alvos’s outstretched hand. She is silent for a long while. Then she says softly, “I never liked being me much, anyway.”</p>
			<p class="indent">She takes her hand.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div class="transition" aria-hidden="true">—</div>
			<p>Several hundred feet above Bulikov, Nokov is very aware that something is very wrong.</p>
			<p class="indent">For one thing, he can’t move. But it’s more than that.</p>
			<p class="indent">He’s powerful enough to understand that something has gone wrong with time. He keeps reliving the same split second over and over and over again, a piece of time so small that it’s almost insignificant. To the outside observer—if someone could resist these effects, that is—he would appear frozen.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_417" epub:type="pagebreak" title="417"></span>But he’s not. Nokov is powerful enough to know that—and he should be powerful enough to overcome what’s happening. He really <i>should</i>. Yet for some reason he can’t resist.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>I am the strongest Divinity to have ever lived</i>, he says in vain. <i>What is wrong? What is happening?</i></p>
			<p class="indent">And then he begins to move.</p>
			<p class="indent">He is pulled upward, up toward the far edge of the tower, where someone, he sees, is now walking down the stairs.</p>
			<p class="indent">It’s a woman. Tall and noble, bloodless and alien-looking, arrayed in…</p>
			<p class="indent">Moments. Seconds. Bands of fate, streams of time. From her arms hang all the tides and all the storms of all the seas, and all the dawns and sunsets; from her back there hangs a cape of all the births and all the deaths, both those that have come and those that have yet to be; and about her waist is a skirt composed of all the frantic desires that time would not pass by, the wish that all these moments, however beautiful or brutal, would persist, and linger, and continue. And at the bottom of this skirt is a broad, black hem, cutting all these wishes short.</p>
			<p class="indent">The woman turns to face him, and he understands she is pulling him to her.</p>
			<p class="indent">A familiar sensation floods Nokov’s mind: the old terror of being trapped by a very dangerous and very pitiless woman.</p>
			<p class="indent">He wants to say, “<i>Who are you?</i>” but the words will not escape his lips.</p>
			<p class="indent">Yet the woman responds as if she heard him. “You know me, Nokov,” she says. “You know me, son of darkness, son of night.”</p>
			<p class="indent">When she speaks, it’s as if he knew what she was going to say, as if she had already said it.</p>
			<p class="indent">“I don’t,” he tries to say. “I don’t know.”</p>
			<p class="indent">She pulls him closer. Her eyes are filled with dying stars.</p>
			<p class="indent">“You do,” she says. “I am the sea in which the night swims. I am the country in which all other Divinities frolic and play their little games. All things you do, all things you have been, they have all happened in my shadow. I am <i>time</i>, Nokov. I am every dawn and every dusk. And so your will and wish means nothing to me.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_418" epub:type="pagebreak" title="418"></span>She pulls him yet closer. Her eyes are now filled with graves and forest fires and babies born bereft of breath.</p>
			<p class="indent">“But I am also the woman whose mother you slaughtered,” she whispers. “I am the woman whose love you devoured. You stole everything from me. You stole my brothers and sisters from me.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I…I had to!” Nokov tries to say. “I had to! It wasn’t right, it wasn’t right what they did to me!”</p>
			<p class="indent">“But the thing I <i>most</i> despise about you,” says the woman, “was that you made me the thing I am now. I was <i>happy</i> being mortal. I was <i>happy</i> being in love. I was <i>happy</i> being small. But you have forced my hand, and made me shed all the things I love like a snake shedding its skin.”</p>
			<p class="indent">She draws him closer. In her eyes are all the seconds that have passed in between the stars, the limitless stretches of time that unspool in the vast abysses of the world.</p>
			<p class="indent">“No one saved me!” Nokov tries to scream. “No one helped me! I was alone, I was alone!”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I will relieve you of your burden,” says the woman. He’s now so close she can whisper into his ear. “All things end, Nokov. I have seen it. I have seen the end of everything.”</p>
			<p class="indent">She extends a single finger to his face.</p>
			<p class="indent">Nokov tries to writhe and scream and sob, but he cannot.</p>
			<p class="indent">“And yours,” she says, “hides behind the next second…”</p>
			<p class="indent">Her finger grows closer.</p>
			<p class="indent">“…like an insect below a stone.”</p>
			<p class="indent">She brushes his cheek.</p>
			<p class="indent">Instantly, Nokov vanishes.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sempros, goddess of time, stands alone upon the stairs.</p>
			<p class="indent">She looks around. If she wanted to she could bat away all the miracles Nokov left behind him: the walls, the stairs, the dead seneschal and its spear below. But she doesn’t.</p>
			<p class="indent">Because it doesn’t matter. She’s going to shut it all down.</p>
			<p class="indent">She closes her eyes and begins.</p>
			<span id="page_419" epub:type="pagebreak" title="419"></span><hr class="transition"/>
			<div class="transition" aria-hidden="true">—</div>
			<p>In one sense, Sempros still stands upon the stairs. But in another, she expands and grows and slips behind reality, ascending it like a vast bird, until she finds the sea of moments upon which all things float, a near-limitless ocean of things that have happened, things that are happening, and things that are waiting to happen.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sempros stands upon the sea of time, her pale feet firm upon the gentle waves.</p>
			<p class="indent">She crouches. The seconds are tiny, but her eyes are sharp. She can see them all.</p>
			<p class="indent">She reaches out and brushes one with her finger. It unspools, unscrolls, and there is a tiny, wordless cry—a cry of pain, a cry of sorrow, a cry as this second suddenly simply never was.</p>
			<p class="indent">She looks up at all the other seconds. And then she starts her work.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div class="transition" aria-hidden="true">—</div>
			<p>On the stairs above Bulikov, Sempros clenches her fists and walks across the air to float above the city—a city that both brought and lived through indescribable pain, a gorgeous capital founded upon slavery and misery, a city plunged into holocaust and bloodshed in a half-second.</p>
			<p class="indent">Time is frozen below her. It’s frozen everywhere, in all things. Yet she still wants them to hear her, to hear her sorrow, to hear her grievances.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sempros cries out, “<i>I have been in this world since before its birth! And I will be here after it fades from this reality! And I say to you now, now at the end of all things, that this world is unjust! That it was born in chaos and inequality and pain, and every second after was shaped by that pain! And I say no more! I will</i> not <i>allow it to continue any longer! I will not allow this injustice anymore! I shall wipe it clean! I shall wipe it clean, wipe it away, and relieve you from this punishment that none of us deserve!</i>”</p>
			<p class="indent">The world stands still below her. Bulikov stands frozen, as does Ahanashtan, and Voortyashtan, and far across the seas, even Ghaladesh. Every molecule, every atom, every speck of light and dust, all of it stands in attention as Sempros begins her terrible work, dissolving the supports upon which reality stands, dissolving reality itself. The world is her frozen audience to her first, last, and greatest act.</p>
			<span id="page_420" epub:type="pagebreak" title="420"></span><hr class="transition"/>
			<div class="transition" aria-hidden="true">—</div>
			<p>Except.</p>
			<p class="indent">Except, except, except.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the streets of Bulikov, a single hand trembles.</p>
			<p class="indent">The hand is bruised and bloody. Its fingernails are cracked, its knuckles raw. And on its palm is a lurid scar.</p>
			<p class="indent">Two scales, waiting to weigh and judge.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud je Harkvaldsson takes a rattling, painful breath.</p>
			<p class="indent">In his ears he hears the seas. They beckon to him, asking him to walk away from the shores of his life, and be swept away. But for some reason he just…He just…</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>I told her I would stay.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">His eyelid flutters. The spear is a lump of ice in his shoulder.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>I told her I would remind her of who she was.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">His left hand, still trembling, slowly rises.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Shall I fail her as well?</i></p>
			<p class="indent">He opens his eye, focuses, and stares at his left palm and the gleaming scar upon its flesh.</p>
			<p class="indent">The words of Olvos echo in his ears: <i>You defy time…</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud takes another breath. His ribs scream in pain at the effort, but he does so anyway, filling every available part of his body with air. Then he exhales, and in doing so says a single, whispered word:</p>
			<p class="indent">“Tatyana.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud grabs the spear with his left hand and begins to pull. Then he plants his feet on the ground and leans forward, pushing away from the wall.</p>
			<p class="indent">The agony is unlike anything he has ever known. He can feel the queer metal grinding against him, against some tendon or bone inside his body. He can feel the flow of his breath quake and shiver with each effort.</p>
			<p class="indent">But he keeps pushing. Until…</p>
			<p class="indent">With a <i>crack,</i> the spear is free.</p>
			<p class="indent">He nearly falls forward into the street, which would be disastrous, but despite the agony thrumming through his body he manages to stay upright. The spear is still lodged in him, huge and heavy, putting downward pressure on his wound.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_421" epub:type="pagebreak" title="421"></span>He stands there in the street, whimpering, quaking, the spear in his breast, his left hand gripping its shaft. His right arm, he knows, is useless. So this will not be easy.</p>
			<p class="indent">He takes a breath. Then he begins to pull the spear up.</p>
			<p class="indent">The torment is indescribable. He can feel every ripple in the shaft of the spear, every bend and buckle in its dark surface. He feels it twitch and shift, grinding his bones and tissues and muscles throughout his body.</p>
			<p class="indent">He screams, long and loud, a ragged scream he didn’t know he was capable of. But he keeps pulling, sliding inch after inch of the spear shaft out of his shoulder. He feels the weight of the spear change and shift, feels it bobbing as he pulls the tip close.</p>
			<p class="indent">He shivers, swallows, and pulls harder, until…</p>
			<p class="indent">His eyes streaming tears, Sigrud je Harkvaldsson slides the black blade of the spear out of his right breast. Then he collapses to the ground, vomiting blood, his right arm growing both cold and warm at once as blood leaves his body and floods out of his wound.</p>
			<p class="indent">He lies there on the street, coughing, his breath crackling and bubbling.</p>
			<p class="indent">He hears waves. He hears the ocean. And he catches the distant, salty fragrance of the sea….</p>
			<p class="indent">He blinks lazily. Lying here on the ground, he can see the figure above him: a woman glowing bright white like a firework, floating in the air before the stairs along the tower wall.</p>
			<p class="indent">His body is shuddering. Everything feels very cold now.</p>
			<p class="indent">Then the building on his right vanishes.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud, trembling and faint, lifts his head to look. It’s not just that the building is gone: where it stood is now a black hole in…well, not space, but <i>everything</i>. It’s difficult for his mind, as fatigued as it is, to make sense of this sight.</p>
			<p class="indent">He slowly understands. It is not just that the building is gone. It’s that it never was. Its time in this existence has been erased.</p>
			<p class="indent">He looks to his left and sees Ivanya disappear as well. More and more buildings disappear behind her.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_422" epub:type="pagebreak" title="422"></span>Sigrud looks up at the bright white figure, then eyes the stairs leading up to her.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>It’s a long way.</i> He lifts his left hand and stares at his palm. <i>Will you keep me alive until then? Shall I persist?</i></p>
			<p class="indent">The scar says nothing, as it always has.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud shuts his eyes. He feels colder and colder. His arms won’t stop shaking.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>I who have waited so long in the halls of death.</i> He looks up. <i>Yet now, of all times, I wish only for a few seconds more.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">He summons his strength, shifts his weight, and rolls over onto his face. He coughs madly, his wound bright and hot with each convulsion. Blood leaks out of his mouth and nose. His left hand flails until he manages to press it flat against the street. Then he slowly, slowly pushes himself up until he’s on his knees.</p>
			<p class="indent">He grasps the black spear. Then he places its butt against the street and, grunting in misery, leans against it until he lifts himself to his feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">He leans against the spear like a drunk against a lamppost, gasping and panting. His lungs beg for oxygen, but only one of them seems to be working properly.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud takes a step forward. His foot holds fast.</p>
			<p class="indent">He chokes, spits out a mouthful of blood, and takes a breath.</p>
			<p class="indent">Slowly, slowly, using the big spear as a crutch, Sigrud hobbles to the foot of the giant black staircase, and begins to climb.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each inch is a struggle, every step a war. His breath is shallow and ragged. Each time he hauls himself up one step, he’s convinced he won’t be able to do so for the next.</p>
			<p class="indent">Yet he does. Leaving a trail of blood behind him, Sigrud climbs the endless staircase, lifting one foot after another.</p>
			<p class="indent">And as he does so, he begins to see things.</p>
			<p class="indent">The first is his father, sitting atop the stairs ahead, nonchalantly chewing a piece of bread and cheese, young and fresh and clear-faced—far younger than Sigrud is now. His clever eyes are bright with joy, and he looks at Sigrud and smiles. “If you want a bite of what I’m eating,” he says, “you’ll have to stand and walk to me. Come on! No crawling!”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_423" epub:type="pagebreak" title="423"></span>Sigrud walks on past his father, staggering up the stairs. He’s sure he’s hallucinating, that this is a sign of his brain failing—yet then he realizes what this was.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>My first steps</i>, he thinks. <i>How is it possible for me to remember this? How young was I?</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud keeps climbing.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the next twist of stairs, things shift, and change—and he sees Slondheim, dark and dingy and miserable, and the face of his chief tormentor, Jarvun, leering at him from rusted bars, his teeth brown as old coffee. “You’re a plum, ain’t you?” the man says, cackling. “A plum, I say. Soft, soft. Just as I likes them.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud staggers on. The vision fades.</p>
			<p class="indent">More stairs. More and more.</p>
			<p class="indent">Things grow soft and strange around him again—another vision.</p>
			<p class="indent">This one of the burned hillside where his house once sat, where he lived with Hild and raised his children. He sees, of all things, himself, young and clean and slender, kneeling in the ashy mud and weeping, holding a handful of charred bones. This younger Sigrud tips forward until his forehead touches the black, sodden earth, and he howls, a cry of unspeakable grief.</p>
			<p class="indent">He knows what this young man believes—that his family is dead and slaughtered, and he is too late to do anything about it. He doesn’t know that his family has been secreted away. Doesn’t know that his suicidal wrath will win him nothing but woe, and set himself upon the path that the elder Sigrud walks now, wounded and bleeding as he climbs the stairs.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud walks past this younger version of himself and continues up the stairs.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>She’s doing something to the past, isn’t she?</i> he realizes. <i>Unwinding it. Destroying it. And with each stroke, the past quakes like wheat before the scythe.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">He glances to his left, out over the edge of the stairs. He’s far up now, farther than he would have ever imagined he could make it, approaching where the tips of the taller buildings would be—but many of them are gone. Much of the world below is gone, wiped away by the Divine machinations occurring above.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_424" epub:type="pagebreak" title="424"></span>He looks up at the glittering figure above him. He’s not even halfway there yet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Can I make it?</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Another step.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Can I?</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud keeps climbing.</p>
			<p class="indent">Things flicker and change, and he sees another vision.</p>
			<p class="indent">Himself, asleep with Hild on some leisurely morning, his hand thoughtlessly strewn across her naked belly. He watches her sleeping, pushes one strand of hair from her face, and gently kisses her temple.</p>
			<p class="indent">He and Shara, setting up an antennae atop a rail yard in Ahanashtan. She, young, laughing, delighted in their exploits. He, grim, silent, cruel.</p>
			<p class="indent">He and his daughter Carin, seated on the floor of his old house, she cradling a cloth doll in her arms. He listens as she explains the doll’s complicated, heroic origins in tones of tremendous gravity.</p>
			<p class="indent">His father, older, graver, sadder, seated at a long table. “The high-minded rhetoric men will use,” he says, “to justify the basest of their instincts…”</p>
			<p class="indent">Then he sees himself, in Fort Thinadeshi in Voortyashtan, sobbing and screaming as he grabs a terrified Saypuri soldier, hurls them against a wall, and plunges his knife into their neck. Blood fans out and splashes his face, his chest, his arm. Then he drops the dying soldier and charges down the hall.</p>
			<p class="indent">As Sigrud staggers through this memory, his eye lingers on the dying soldier. This one a young man not yet twenty-five.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>How many years did I take from people that night?</i> he thinks. <i>How many years have I stolen from others throughout my life?</i></p>
			<p class="indent">He sees Olvos, standing by the fire, pointing at him and saying, “This was born in blood. It always was. It was born in conquest, born in power, born in righteous vengeance. And that is how it means to end. This is a cycle, repeating itself over and over again, just as your life repeats itself over and over again. We must break that cycle. We <i>must</i>. Or else we doom future generations to follow in our footsteps.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud walks on and on, his blood sprinkling the stairs. The ground grows smaller below him. His body is cold, faint, distant.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_425" epub:type="pagebreak" title="425"></span><i>I have lived as a wounded animal</i>, he thinks, <i>seeking to inflict my pain on the world.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">He grips the spear tight in his left hand as he hobbles up the stairs.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>I thought my pain was a power of its own</i>, he thinks. <i>What awful foolishness this was.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">More stairs, more and more.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Will I let the same thing happen to Taty? Will I let her make my mistakes all over again, before my very eyes?</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Then he sees it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Himself, not yet seventeen. And in his arms, an infant child.</p>
			<p class="indent">Young, tiny, perfect, frowning in discomfort.</p>
			<p class="indent">This younger Sigrud lowers his head to the infant’s ear, and whispers: “Signe. That’s your name. Signe. But I wonder—who will you be?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud shuts his eye as he tries to move past this moment. Then his toe catches the edge of a stair, and he stumbles.</p>
			<p class="indent">He crashes to the stairs, the spear falling from his grasp. His breast howls with pain. Everything hurts, every piece of him is torment, and though he tries he can’t push himself back up.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud sobs, weary and miserable. “I can’t,” he whispers. “I can’t do it. I can’t.”</p>
			<p class="indent">He shuts his eye, knowing that he’s failed, knowing what it means. The world will not simply vanish—it will be as if it never was.</p>
			<p class="indent">He opens his eye to see it coming, to see the world dissolve and the abyss take him. And he sees he is not alone.</p>
			<p class="indent">There is someone standing on the stairs above him.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud looks up.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is a woman, mid-thirties, dressed in leather boots and a sealskin coat. On the breast of this coat is an insignia—the insignia of the Southern Dreyling Company, accompanied by a small gear. The woman looks down on him, her blond hair bright in the light of the figure above her, her blue eyes passionate behind her glasses.</p>
			<p class="indent">She says something. Sigrud is now so faint he can’t hear what she says. But he can see it’s three words, and he knows they’re words she spoke to him long ago, when she declared her life’s purpose to him, a bold statement of grim, determined hope:</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_426" epub:type="pagebreak" title="426"></span><i>One big push.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud nods, weeping. “All right,” he says. “All right.”</p>
			<p class="indent">He gathers himself, rolls over once more. Then he works his left hand into position and pushes himself back up onto his knees. He reaches down and grasps the shaft of the spear, which luckily has not fallen the rest of the way down. Then he hauls himself back up to his feet, one last time.</p>
			<p class="indent">One step more. Then another, and another.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>In each moment, I thought of what I’d lost</i>, he thinks.</p>
			<p class="indent">Another step, another.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Of what was done to me, and how to inflict my own justice on this world.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Another, another, another.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>But I know better now, here at the end.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">And then finally, he comes to her.</p>
			<p class="indent">The woman who hangs in the air has the look of Tatyana Komayd to her, and a dash of Malwina Gogacz: there is the small nose, the weak chin, the pugnacious mouth. She floats about twenty feet past the edge of the staircase, her hands lifted, her eyes turned to the heavens. Her eyes shine brightly, their pure white luminescence lancing up past the top of the tower. Yet her face is twisted in sorrow and grief, and her cheeks are wet with tears: a creature, however Divine, overwhelmed with despair.</p>
			<p class="indent">He knows that look. He looked the same way when he lost his father, his family, his daughter, his friend.</p>
			<p class="indent">And then he understands: it’s a loop, an endless loop of injured children, growing old but keeping their pain fresh and new, causing yet more injury and starting the whole cycle over again.</p>
			<p class="indent">He looks at the goddess, and sees only the young girl who stared up at the moon a few nights ago, and declared the dead a mystery to her.</p>
			<p class="indent">“Death is no place to look for meaning, Taty,” he says to her. He tosses the spear away, letting it roll down the stairs. He slowly walks back along the stairs, until he backs up to the wall of the tower. “You told me that.”</p>
			<p class="indent">He looks at the gap. Twenty feet from the stairs to her. Can he make it? Even in such an injured state?</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>I will have to.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">He crouches down, positions his feet, readies himself.</p>
			<p class="indent">“I will remind you,” he whispers.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_427" epub:type="pagebreak" title="427"></span>He runs along the step, a hobbling, drunken, halting run, but still fast, still strong.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud comes to the edge.</p>
			<p class="indent">He leaps.</p>
			<p class="indent">He soars out, arm extended, the frozen city of Bulikov below him, the endless dark tower stretching above.</p>
			<p class="indent">He flies to her, reaches out, touches her shoulder, grabs her and holds her close, and then…</p>
			<p class="indent">All the moments crash in around him.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div class="transition" aria-hidden="true">—</div>
			<p>Sigrud sits upon a white plane.</p>
			<p class="indent">The plane is vast and never-ending, and though he doesn’t understand it, he knows the plane stretches in all directions, all at once. Yet still, he sits upon it, nude and cross-legged, his scarred, bruised, wounded body bared to the light that seems to come from all directions.</p>
			<p class="indent">Something shifts around him. He realizes that this plane, this place, exists in the palm of someone’s hand—someone inconceivably vast.</p>
			<p class="indent">“HOW DARE YOU,” says a voice.</p>
			<p class="indent">Things keep shifting. And then she raises him up to her eyes.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud sees the goddess before him, holding him before her gaze, all of time swirling in her grasp. Her eyes are filled with dying suns and the howl of a thousand storms, with a thousand raindrops falling upon a thousand leaves, a thousand whispered words and a thousand laughs and a thousand tears.</p>
			<p class="indent">Her face twists in naked fury. “HOW DARE YOU INTERRUPT ME,” says the goddess. “HOW DARE YOU DEFY TIME.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud looks at the goddess, and blinks slowly. “I do not defy it,” he says. “I am simply fulfilling a promise I made to a young girl not that long ago.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I AM NO LONGER SHE,” thunders the goddess. “I AM MUCH, MUCH MORE THAN SHE EVER WAS, THAN SHE EVER COULD BE.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“And yet,” says Sigrud, “she was far wiser than you are now.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The goddess stares at him, outraged. “YOU KNOW NOTHING OF WHAT YOU SPEAK. I WILL REMAKE TIME, REMAKE THE WORLD. I WILL MAKE A JUST WORLD, A MORAL WORLD, A WORLD FREE OF VIOLATIONS AND WRONGS AND PUNISHMENTS.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_428" epub:type="pagebreak" title="428"></span>“Tatyana,” says Sigrud softly, “Malwina…How many times have we been here before?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. NEVER HAS TIME AWOKEN. NEVER HAS TIME ITSELF REFORGED CREATION.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“Perhaps not,” says Sigrud. “But how many times has one person performed an unspeakable atrocity, all in the name of making the world better? The Divinities, the Kaj, Vinya, Nokov…And now you? Will you join their ranks?”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I AM FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN THEY EVER WERE!” shouts the goddess. “I WILL DO IT RIGHT THIS TIME!”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I am sure they said the same.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS,” she says.</p>
			<p class="indent">“You are wrong,” says Sigrud. “I have done the same. I have done what you are about to do.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The goddess hesitates, confused.</p>
			<p class="indent">“When my daughter died,” Sigrud says quietly, “I was filled with fury and grief, and I killed those soldiers. It felt righteous. It felt just. But it was monstrous, beyond monstrous. For all my righteousness, I made the world worse.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“PERHAPS THEY DESERVED IT,” says the goddess. “OR PERHAPS THEY DIDN’T. THAT IS BUT ONE OF MANY SINS THAT I WILL RIGHT. I WILL MAKE A WORLD WHERE WE GET WHAT IS JUST, WHAT WE DESERVE.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“You cannot,” says Sigrud. “You are as powerless as I was. The world is written upon your heart just as it is mine. Pick up all the weapons of all realities and use them all as best you can, Taty, but you cannot inflict virtue on the world. You cannot.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The goddess stares at him. “YOU WHO HAVE SUFFERED. YOU WHO HAVE BEEN WRONGED AND VIOLATED. YOU WHO HAVE KILLED AND MURDERED AND MADE WAR UPON THIS WORLD. YOU SAY NOW THAT THERE IS NO JUSTICE?”</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_429" epub:type="pagebreak" title="429"></span>“Not like this,” he says. “Not like this. And I should know. I lost precious things in my life. I suffered. And I thought that suffering made me righteous. But I was wrong, Taty. I tried to teach you this. But how could I teach you this if I had not learned these lessons myself?” He bows his head. “I…I saw my life laid out upon the stairs,” he whispers. “I gave so many of my own years to wrath, and I stole so many years from other people. How selfish I was. How many wonders I ignored….If only I had looked beyond my pain. If only I had laid aside my torment, and chosen to live anew. But I did not, and I lost so much. Yet you will lose so, so much more if you do this.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The goddess hesitates. He can see it in her face, just a flash of it—a look reminiscent of one he saw on Taty’s face, and Malwina’s: of anguish, of sorrow, and yet the desire to do right.</p>
			<p class="indent">“Tatyana, Malwina,” he says. “Let go of your embers, before you are burned too deeply.”</p>
			<p class="indent">“I WANT TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT,” she says.</p>
			<p class="indent">“Shara Komayd once had this chance,” says Sigrud. “A chance to draw from her pain, and force her will upon the world. She chose instead to give people the tools to make their own worlds better. She lived, and died, to do this. I know she taught you this, Tatyana Komayd. And I know you do not wish to lose what she taught you.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The goddess looks away, thinking. She trembles. “I…I JUST WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN THERE FOR HER,” she says.</p>
			<p class="indent">“I know,” Sigrud says.</p>
			<p class="indent">“I WISH I COULD HAVE SAID GOOD-BYE,” she says.</p>
			<p class="indent">“I know,” says Sigrud. “I know. I know, I know, I know.”</p>
			<p class="indent">The goddess raises her other hand, and things begin to change.</p>
			<p class="indent">The vast white plane begins to blur and whirl and shift, collapsing in on the point just above the palm of her hand. As it does, the goddess transforms: she is no longer the tall, towering being adorned with all moments of all things. She shrinks, she grows younger, imperfect, until finally she is a small Continental girl who is not quite Malwina Gogacz, and not quite Tatyana Komayd either.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_430" epub:type="pagebreak" title="430"></span>The white plane collapses until it is a bright, bright star in her palm. She looks at him, her eyes full of tears, and looks at the star.</p>
			<p class="indent">“I don’t want this,” she says quietly. “I don’t want to be this anymore.” She lifts the star to her lips and gives a tiny puff.</p>
			<p class="indent">The star dissolves like the seeds of a dandelion and goes dancing through the air, all these tiny, soft lights scattered to the winds.</p>
			<p class="indent">The girl bows her head and bursts into tears. “I miss her, Sigrud,” she says. “I miss her <i>so much</i>.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud says, “I know.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Everything vanishes.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div class="transition" aria-hidden="true">—</div>
			<p>Sigrud falls.</p>
			<p class="indent">He’s falling, but not at the speed of someone tumbling through the air: rather, he senses he’s being carefully lowered.</p>
			<p class="indent">He opens his eye.</p>
			<p class="indent">The girl—Taty? Malwina? He’s not sure—holds him in her arms as if he were a child. Together they slowly float down to earth, and as they do the black tower unravels around them, dissipating and dissolving.</p>
			<p class="indent">He’s weak now, terribly weak. He’s shivering, he’s so cold. Yet he manages to look at the face of the girl holding him.</p>
			<p class="indent">She’s weeping, her cheeks covered in tears. “Go away, go away,” she whispers. “All of this can go away.”</p>
			<p class="indent">They land as light as a thrush upon a branch. Suddenly Ivanya is there, staring at them.</p>
			<p class="indent">“What in hells?” says Ivanya. “What…What just happened? Where’s Nokov?”</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud tries to smile and say, “Ivanya—you’re back,” yet he has no air for it.</p>
			<p class="indent">The girl gently lays him on the ground. As she does, he looks at his left hand and the scar there, the miracle that’s dominated his life.</p>
			<p class="indent">The scar is fading away, the lines unraveling like the threads of an old sweater.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>I thought my sorrow was a weapon</i>, he thinks, watching it.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is just the barest whisper of a line now.</p>
			<p class="indent"><span id="page_431" epub:type="pagebreak" title="431"></span><i>Yet all this time, it was simply a burden. And how I suffered because of it.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">The scar is almost gone.</p>
			<p class="indent">Pain seizes him. He begins convulsing. He feels the blood flow from his wound double, triple, a waterfall of blood from his right breast.</p>
			<p class="indent">“What’s going on?” says Ivanya, alarmed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sigrud is trembling, so he can’t answer her, but he knows: the miracle that kept him alive for so long is abandoning him. He’s becoming a common, mortal man, as susceptible to wounds as any other.</p>
			<p class="indent">“No!” cries the girl. “No, no!” She snatches at his left palm like he’s got some treasure hidden there, then rips something out—something black and fragile, like a spiderweb. She crushes it, and slaps it to the wound on his right breast. His wound screams in pain, and he feels something slip <i>inside</i> him, writhing under his skin.</p>
			<p class="indent">Then things go dark.</p>
