			<h1 class="para-bmt-ack-pg">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h1>
			<p class="para-bmpf">Thanks to Brent Weeks, who read <i class="char-i">City of Stairs</i> and gave me some very foresighted advice about the state of Sigrudâ€™s health.</p>
			<p class="para-bmp">Thanks to my editor, Julian Pavia, for helping me cut one whole book out of the middle of this one, much to the improvement of everything.</p>
			<p class="para-bmp">Thanks to Deanna Hoak and Justin Landon, whose observations about these books have fueled ideas for future ones. Innovation sometimes arises from the simplest mistakes.</p>
			<p class="para-bmp">Much thanks to Myke Cole, for taking time out of his busy schedule to educate me on all things military for this novel. I now know the difference between a clandestine and a covert operation.</p>
			<p class="para-bmp">Many thanks to Ashlee and Jackson, who continue to tolerate me for reasons unknown.</p>
			<p class="para-bmp">And many, many thanks to those who read <i class="char-i">City of Stairs,</i> without whose support this book would surely not exist.</p>
