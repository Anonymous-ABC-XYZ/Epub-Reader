<p class="calibre36"> </p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>The compound beyond the gate was empty. Crokus ran across it, wondering if he was too late. He bounded up the steps and reached for the door latch. A burst of energy flung him backward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Dazed, the thief found himself sitting on the paving stones before the steps, his flesh tingling. At the door a deep crimson glow slowly faded. A ward. “Hood!” he hissed, climbing to his feet. He’d run into barriers like these before, in the Higher Estates. There was no way to get through them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Cursing again, Crokus whirled and raced to the gate. He emerged onto the street and looked around, seeing no one. If those Crimson Guard still protected him, they weren’t showing themselves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">There was a slight chance that the garden entrance to Baruk’s estate was unguarded by magic—a very slight chance. He ran down the street and turned into the first alley to his right. There’d be a wall to scale, but he did not consider that much of an obstacle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He came to the alley’s end and skidded to a halt on the street beyond. The wall was high, he saw. He’d need a running start. Crokus trotted across the street, trying to catch his breath. What was the point of all this? Couldn’t Baruk take care of himself, after all? Wasn’t he a High Mage, and hadn’t even Fingers commented on the alchemist’s sorcerous defenses?</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He hesitated, scowling at the wall opposite him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">At that moment a piercing, earth-shaking scream was loosed directly above the street. Crokus threw himself against the wall behind him as an enormous shape descended into the gaslight. Filling the street, it struck the ground less than twenty yards to the thief’s left. He was thrown from his feet by the impact. Stones shattered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He ducked beneath the hail of bricks and cobbles, then, as the scatter of rubble diminished, he jumped to his feet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A dragon, its wings tattered and streaked with blood, slowly regained its feet in the street, wagging its massive wedge-shaped head from side to side. Along its brown flanks, scales had been torn away, revealing deep puncture wounds. Its neck and shoulders glistened with blood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus saw that the wall beyond it—Baruk’s—had been obliterated, opening the garden to his view. Snapped tree trunks rose amid steaming earth. A raised patio marked the approach of the estate’s back entrance. Two toppled statues lay in pieces before the doors.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The dragon looked stunned. Crokus tensed. Now was the time to move. Almost disbelieving his own temerity, the thief darted into the street behind the creature, hoping to reach the cover of the garden. His gaze remained on the dragon as he ran, his thoughts on the coin of luck in his pocket.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>Then, before his eyes, the creature’s shape changed, drawing into itself in a shimmering haze. Crokus slowed, then stopped, unable to pull away his attention. His heart hammered against his ribs, as if seeking escape. Each drawn breath was a painful gasp. His luck, he told himself in terror, had just ended.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The shimmering faded, and a giant man-shaped apparition now stood on the street, cloaked and cowled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus tried to will himself to move, but his body refused to obey. He stared, eyes widening, as the demon turned to him. It snarled and removed an enormous ax from its belt. Hefting the weapon, it spoke in a deep, soft voice. “What reason to continue this?” it asked reasonably. “The Empress permits your escape, Lord. Once again she grants you mercy. Accept it, and leave.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Good idea,” the thief whispered. Then he frowned, for the demon’s attention, he now saw, was directed past him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A man spoke behind him. “We run no further, Galayn.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A hand fell on the thief’s shoulder, breaking the spell of immobility. Crokus ducked and spun to one side, then looked up into shifting, indigo eyes set in a black, narrow face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Flee, mortal,” the silver-haired man said, drawing a two-handed sword from the scabbard slung between his shoulder-blades. The black weapon seemed almost invisible, as if it swallowed all light that found it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You were at the fête!” Crokus blurted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The man’s eyes flickered, as if seeing him for the first time. “Coin Bearer,” he said, with a wry smile, “fear not. Brood has convinced me to spare you, at least for the moment. Begone, child.” His gaze returned to the Galayn lord. “This will be a close thing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I know that weapon,” the demon snarled. “Dragnipurake. And I smell the reek of Tiama in you, Lord. There is more of her in you than Tiste Andii blood.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus backed against what remained of Baruk’s wall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Galayn lord grinned, revealing long, curved canines. “The Empress would reward your services, Lord. You’ve only to say yes, and this battle can be avoided.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Anomander Rake stepped forward. “Attend, Galayn.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">With a roar the demon attacked, ax whistling through the air and streaming blue flames.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rake whirled his sword in a circle, catching the ax and adding to its momentum. As the double-blades swept past, the Tiste Andii stepped in close, sword drawn back, pommel against his left hip. In a blur of motion he extended the blade. The demon ducked and, releasing one hand from the ax haft, reached for Rake’s throat. The Tiste Andii twisted his right shoulder and caught the blow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Thrown backward, Rake landed heavily on the cobbles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The demon pounced, flaming weapon above its head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rake regained his feet in time to catch the ax with his sword. The clash of weapons sent a jolt through the air and ground. The demon’s ax flared bright white, cascading light like liquid. Rake’s sword was swallowed in darkness, devouring the lashing waves of light that struck it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>The flagstones beneath Crokus’s feet tilted sickeningly, as if the stones themselves had turned to soft clay. Overhead the stars swam wildly. Gripped by nausea, Crokus fell to his knees.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rake began to launch attacks, savage swings of his black weapon. At first the demon held its ground, delivering fierce ripostes, then staggered back a step, then another. Relentless, Rake pressed his attack. <em class="calibre11">“To the Mother’s regret,”</em> he grated between blows, <em class="calibre11">“was Light granted birth. To her dismay . . . she saw too late . . . its corruption. Galayn . . . you are the unintended victim . . . to punishment . . . long overdue.”</em></span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The demon reeled beneath the blows, desperately parrying every attack, no longer counterattacking. The light bleeding from the axe flickered, dimmed, flared fitfully as darkness closed in around the blade. Shrieking, the demon launched itself at Rake. As it descended over the Tiste Andii, Crokus saw a streak of black burst from the demon’s back, slicing through the cloak. The ax flew from the creature’s hands, its fire dying as it clattered on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Squealing in horror, the demon clawed at the sword impaling it. Black smoke spread in swift tendrils from the weapon, engulfing the demon. The smoke twisted, became chains, drawing taut. The Galayn screamed in earnest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rake regained his feet and pushed the sword through the demon’s chest until the hilt jammed against bone. The demon sank to its knees, its black eyes locking with Rake’s own.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The swimming stars settled, the flagstones beneath the thief became solid once again, though warped and twisted. Crokus swallowed bile, his eyes fixed on the demon. It seemed to collapse in on itself, the chains of black smoke ever tightening, pulling the creature into the sword. It toppled backward and Rake drove the weapon’s point into the cobbled street, pinning the demon. Then the Tiste Andii leaned heavily on the hilt, and Crokus now noticed the blood-soaked cloth surrounding Rake’s shoulder, where the demon’s hand had struck. Wearily, the Tiste Andii swung his gaze to the thief.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Move quickly,” he rasped. “The alchemist is in danger. I cannot protect him now. Hurry, Coin Bearer.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus whirled and ran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">The death of Travale, third in the Cabal, still echoed in their thoughts. The witch Derudan had inscribed an ash circle on the floor in the center of the chamber. With Baruk’s help, she placed the two plush chairs within it, and now sat, smoking steadily, her dark eyes following the alchemist as he paced.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk found himself reluctant to enter the protective circle. While they would be safe there, surrounded by High Tennes sorcery, they would not be able to counterattack, should Vorcan arrive. More, some things could penetrate the defenses of magic. Otataral, that strange rustlike ore from the Tanno Hills of Seven Cities, immediately came to mind. It was unlikely that Vorcan would possess such material, given that she was a High Mage, yet still Baruk felt reluctant <a class="calibre3"></a>to place himself in a position where he could not use his Warren against the assassin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Those of the Cabal,” Derudan said slowly, “who are now dead, yes? Stubborn, convinced of their own invincibility. No doubt they paced restless steps, awaiting the assassin’s imminent arrival.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk paused to reply, but was interrupted by a loud, inhuman scream from outside. This was followed immediately by a concussion that rattled the walls. The alchemist made a move toward the door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Wait!” Derudan called from the circle. “Appease not this curiosity, Baruk, for Vorcan will surely take advantage, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“A ward was shattered,” Baruk said. “My defenses are breached.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“More the reason for caution,” Derudan admonished. “Friend, I plead with you, join me here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Very well,” Baruk sighed, moving toward her. A gust of air brushed the left side of his face. Derudan cried out a warning even as the alchemist turned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Vorcan, her gloved hands glowing red, surged toward Baruk. He raised his arms, knowing full well that he would be too late. At that moment, however, another figure appeared, emerging from darkness to intercept the Master Assassin with a flurry of blows. Vorcan reeled back, then lashed out with a hand, catching her attacker a glancing blow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">An agonized shriek rang through the chamber. Baruk stared, only now realizing that his protector was a Tiste Andii woman. He stepped aside lithely as she flew past him to strike the floor then the wall, where she lay unmoving. The alchemist pulled his gaze back to Vorcan, seeing that one of her hands no longer glowed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He gestured, and virulent sorcery erupted from his arm, arcing yellow lightning. Vorcan hissed a counter-spell and the lightning was swallowed by a red haze before her that dimmed quickly, then disappeared. She advanced.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Vaguely, Baruk heard the witch Derudan shouting at him. Yet it was the Mistress of the Assassins’ death-filled eyes that held him. The ease with which she’d dispelled his power made it clear that she was his master in sorcery. All he could do now, he understood with clarity, was await his death.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">But Baruk heard a grunt behind him, then Vorcan gasped. The hilt of a dagger protruded from the assassin’s chest. Frowning, she reached for it, then pulled it out and tossed it aside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“All . . .” the alchemist heard the Tiste Andii woman gasp from the floor behind him “. . . all I can do. My apologies, Lord.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Derudan appeared behind Vorcan. As she raised her hands and began an incantation, Vorcan whirled and something sped from her hand. The witch grunted, then crumpled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Anguish flooded Baruk. With a wordless roar he launched himself at Vorcan. She laughed and ducked to one side, throwing out her glowing hand. The alchemist twisted, off-balance, narrowly avoiding the killing touch, then staggered past. He heard her laughter again, as she moved in behind him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>A dozen feet in front of Baruk was the door. The alchemist’s eyes widened to find it open. A youth crouched there, holding blockish objects in each hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Expecting at any moment to feel Vorcan’s touch, Baruk threw himself forward. He saw the boy straighten at the same time and thrust forward first his right arm, then his left. As the alchemist fell toward the floor, two bricks flew over him. He heard them strike the woman behind him, one making a crunching sound, the other crackling. A flash of red accompanied the crackle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">As he struck the floor, the breath was hammered from Baruk’s lungs. Agonized seconds passed as he struggled to draw air into his tortured chest. He rolled onto his back. Vorcan, he saw, lay motionless almost against his feet. The boy’s face came into view, streaked with sweat, brow furrowed with concern.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Alchemist Baruk?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The man nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The boy sighed, then grinned. “You’re alive. Good. Rallick sent me to warn you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk sat up. “The witch,” he said hoarsely. He pointed. “Tend to her, please.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He felt his strength returning as he watched the boy crouch beside Derudan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“She’s breathing,” Crokus announced. “There’s some kind of knife in her, looks like it’s covered in sap.” He reached down to touch it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“No!” Baruk shouted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus jumped back in alarm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Poison,” the alchemist said, climbing to his feet. “Help me to her, quickly.” A moment later he knelt beside Derudan. A quick glance at the saplike substance coating the blade confirmed his suspicion. “White paralt,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“That’s a spider, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk laid a hand on Derudan. “Your knowledge surprises me, boy,” he said. “Fortunately, she’s in the home of the one man who possesses its antidote.” He muttered something and a vial appeared in his hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Rallick said there was no antidote to white paralt.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“It’s not something I’m likely to announce.” Baruk unstoppered the vial and poured the contents down the witch’s throat, triggering a coughing fit. As Derudan’s breathing became even, Baruk leaned back and eyed Crokus. “You seem well acquainted with Rallick. What’s your name?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Crokus. Mammot was my uncle, sir. I saw him die.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Derudan’s eyelids flickered, then opened. She smiled lazily. “What I see pleases me,” she said weakly. “Yes?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk returned the smile. “Yes, my friend. But I make no claim for defeating Vorcan. That falls to Crokus, nephew of Mammot.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Derudan’s gaze swung to the youth. “Ah, the one I came near to treading on earlier this evening.” The amusement left her expression. “I am sorry for Mammot, child.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“So am I,” he replied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk rose and turned. He hissed a vehement curse. Vorcan’s body was gone. “She’s fled.” He hurried over to the Tiste Andii woman; he bent down and <a class="calibre3"></a>examined her. She was dead. “I will soon know your name,” he whispered, “and I will remember it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I have to go!” Crokus announced.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk wondered at the sudden panic in the boy’s face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I mean,” Crokus continued, “if everything’s over here, that is.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I believe it is,” the alchemist answered. “I thank you, Crokus, for your skill at throwing bricks.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The boy went to the door. He paused, then tossed a coin into the air. He caught it, and grinned tightly. “Just lucky, I suppose.” Then he was gone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Captain Paran crouched beside Coll’s bed. “Still asleep,” he said, rising and facing Whiskeyjack. “Go ahead.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kalam and the two saboteurs had arrived minutes earlier. So far, the sergeant mused, no losses, though the captain’s armor had taken a beating and the look in his face when he’d entered the room with Lorn’s body in his arms warned Whiskeyjack away from probing Paran’s state of mind too deeply. The Adjunct’s body now occupied a second bed, motionless and pale, a strange ironic smile curving her bloodless lips.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The sergeant studied everyone in the small room, the faces he knew so well all watching him, waiting. His gaze held on Sorry, or Apsalar as she now called herself. Whatever Mallet had done to her, she was a changed woman from the one he’d known. Less, and somehow more as well. Even Mallet was unsure of what he’d done. Certain memories, skills, had been freed, and with them a brutal knowledge. The pain was there in the woman’s eyes, a pain layered in years of horror—yet it seemed that she had it under control, that she’d found a way, a strength, to live with what she’d been. Her only words upon meeting him had been: “I wish to return home, Sergeant.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He had no objection, though he wondered how she planned to cross two continents and the ocean between them. Whiskeyjack reached for the wrapped forearm bones lying on the table. “Yes, sir,” he said, in answer to Paran’s command.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The hot sweaty air in the room thickened with tension. Whiskeyjack hesitated. There’d been a battle in Darujhistan’s streets, and Quick Ben had confirmed the Galayn lord’s death. In fact, the black wizard seemed still in shock. The sergeant sighed under his breath and massaged his newly healed leg, then drove the forearm’s blade into the tabletop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Contact was immediate. High Fist Dujek’s gravelly voice filled the room. “About time, Whiskeyjack! Don’t bother telling me about the Galayn lord—Tayschrenn’s in a coma or something. Everyone in Headquarters heard his scream. So Anomander Rake took out the beast. What else?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Whiskeyjack glanced at Paran, who nodded deferentially. “Adjunct Lorn’s gambit failed,” the sergeant said. “She’s dead. We have her body with us. The intersections remain mined—we’re not detonating them, High Fist, since they’re likely to open the gas caverns beneath the city and turn us all into ash. So.” He drew a deep breath, feeling a twinge from his leg—Mallet had done what <a class="calibre3"></a>he could, and that’d been a lot, but some damage remained, and it made him feel fragile. “So,” he repeated softly, “we’re pulling out, High Fist.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Dujek was silent, then he grunted. “Problems, Whiskeyjack. One, we’re about to lose Pale. As I suspected, Caladan Brood left the Crimson Guard to handle things up north, and marched down here with his Tiste Andii. He’s also got Rhivi with him, and Jorrick’s Barghast, who’ve just finished chewing up Gold Moranth. Two, it gets worse.” The High Fist swallowed audibly. “Seven Cities is maybe a week away from open rebellion. The Empress knows it. Some Claw from Genabaris arrived half an hour ago, looking for Tayschrenn. My people got to him first. Whiskeyjack, he was carrying a handwritten message from the Empress to Tayschrenn. I’ve just been outlawed by the Empire. It’s official, and Tayschrenn was to have effected my arrest and execution. We’re on our own, friend.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The room was silent. Whiskeyjack closed his eyes briefly. “Understood, High Fist. So, when do you march?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Seems the Black Moranth are with us—don’t ask why. Anyway, I have a parley at dawn tomorrow with Caladan Brood and Kallor. That will decide matters, I suspect. Either he lets us walk, or he kills us taking Pale. Everything’s riding on what he knows about the Pannion Seer.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Whiskeyjack said, “We’re rendezvousing with some Black Moranth in a couple of days, High Fist. Makes me wonder how much they’d guessed when that arrangement was made. Anyway, they’ll take us to you, wherever you are.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“No,” Dujek replied. “We may be under siege here. The Black will drop you off on the Catlin Plain. Their orders are clear on this, but you’re welcome to try overruling them.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The sergeant grimaced. Not likely. “Catlin Plain it is. Just means it’ll take us longer to get to you, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The glow surrounding the bones flickered briefly and they heard an echoing thump. Fiddler chuckled. Dujek had just pounded a fist on the table at his end of the conversation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Whiskeyjack shot the saboteur a ferocious look.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Captain Paran?” Dujek bellowed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Here, High Fist,” Paran replied, stepping forward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“What I’m about to say is to Whiskeyjack, but I want you to hear it, Captain.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I’m listening.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Sergeant, if you want to be in my army, you’d better get used to the new order. First, I’m placing the Bridgeburners under Captain Paran’s command. Second, you’re not a sergeant anymore, Whiskeyjack. You are my second-in-command, and that means responsibilities. I don’t want you anywhere near Pale. And you know I’m right, dammit. Captain Paran?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Whiskeyjack’s squad has earned the right to walk. Understood? If any of them elect to rejoin the Bridgeburners, fine. But I don’t want any recriminations if they decide otherwise. I trust that’s clear.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Yes, High Fist.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>“And with Whiskeyjack between commissions,” Dujek continued inexorably, “he’s just coming along for the ride, if you follow me, Captain.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran grinned. “I do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Now, the Black Moranth will know the story by the time they pick you up, so go with them.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Yes, High Fist.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Dujek growled, “Questions, Whiskeyjack?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“No,” the grizzled veteran answered glumly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“All right. Hopefully, we’ll talk later.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The bones’ glow died.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Captain Paran rounded on the soldiers. He studied each face. <em class="calibre11">They were to have been my command. I could not have done better anywhere</em>. “Very well,” he said gruffly. “Who is ready to be outlawed and counted among Dujek’s rebels?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Trotts was the first to rise, his teeth bared. He was followed by Quick Ben, Hedge, and Mallet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">There was a shocked silence, then Kalam nodded at Fiddler and cleared his throat. “We’re with you, only we’re not going with you. Me and Fiddler, that is.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Can you explain that?” Paran asked quietly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Apsalar spoke up, surprising everyone. “They’ll find that hard to do, Captain. And, I admit, I’m not sure what they’re up to, but they’re coming with me. Back to the Empire. Home.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">With an uneasy shrug, Fiddler rose and faced Whiskeyjack. “We feel we owe it to her, sir,” he said. He looked to the captain. “And we’re settled on it, sir. But we’re coming back, if we can.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Bemused, Whiskeyjack pushed himself painfully to his feet. As he turned to face Paran, he froze. Behind the captain, Coll sat upright on the bed. “Um,” Whiskeyjack said, gesturing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Tension burgeoned in the room once again as everyone swung to Coll. Paran stepped forward in genuine relief.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Coll! I’m—” He stopped abruptly, then said tonelessly, “You’ve been awake for some time, I see.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Coll’s eyes flicked to the bones stuck in the tabletop, then returned to Paran. “Heard it all,” he said. “So tell me, Paran, do you soldiers need any help getting out of Darujhistan?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Rallick stood in the darkness beneath the trees at the edge of the glade. It seemed that his magic-deadening powers had proved insufficient after all. He’d been driven from his seat by what had felt like a giant hand—a god’s hand, sure and powerful and unyielding. He’d watched in astonishment as a maze of roots clambered swiftly across the clearing, headed toward the terrace. He’d heard a shriek, then the roots returned, wrapped around a man-shaped . . . apparition, which the roots pulled unceremoniously into the earth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rallick had been filled suddenly with near-euphoria. He knew with unaccountable certainty, that what grew here was right, and just.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>It was new, young. Even now, as he continued watching it, he saw trembles of shaping ripple beneath its angular, geometric surfaces. What had been no more than a tree stump less than an hour ago was now a house. A massive door lay half buried in shadows beneath an arching branch. Vines barred shuttered windows. A balcony hung above and to the left of the door, festooned with leaves and creepers. It led into a kind of tower, turreted above the second story and shingled to a gnarled peak. Another tower marked the house’s front right flank, this one stockier and windowless, its roof flat with jagged merlons lining the edge. He suspected that this roof was a platform, with access through a trapdoor of some kind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The glade around the structure had changed, too, becoming mounded here and there as if the house’s yard was a burial ground. Young, scraggly trees ringed each oblong mound, each growing as if an invisible wind twisted them away from the humped, grassy earth. The roots had dragged the apparition into one such mound.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">It felt right, and just. These two words echoed in the assassin’s head, with an appeal that wrapped calm around his heart. He almost imagined he felt an affinity with this child-house—as if it knew of him and accepted him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He knew the house to be empty. Another sourceless certainty.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rallick continued watching, as the lines of the house grew firm, sharply defined. A musty smell pervaded the area, as of freshly turned earth. The assassin felt at peace.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A moment later he heard thrashing behind him, and whirled to see Vorcan stagger through the undergrowth. Her face was covered in blood from a gash to her brow, and she nearly collapsed into Rallick’s arms.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Tiste Andii,” she gasped. “After me. Hunting. They seek to avenge a murder!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rallick looked past her, and his eyes, long accustomed to the surrounding darkness, detected silent movement among the trees, closing in. He hesitated, gripping the now unconscious woman in his arms. Then he bent down, threw Vorcan over one shoulder, turned, and ran toward the house.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He knew that the door would open for him, and it did. Beyond was a dark antechamber and an archway leading into a hallway running from side to side. A gust of warm, sweet air flowed over Rallick, and he entered without pause.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Korlat, blood-kin to Serrat, slowed as she approached the strange house. The door had closed behind their quarry. She came to the edge of the clearing, then squatted on her haunches. Her fellow hunters gathered slowly around her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Horult hissed angrily, then said, “Have you summoned our lord, Korlat?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The woman shook her head. “I know of such creations from old,” she said. “The Deadhouse of Malaz City, the Odhanhouse of Seven Cities . . . <em class="calibre11">Azath edieimarn</em>, Pillars of Innocence—this door will not open to us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Yet it opened to them,” Horult said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“There is precedence. The Azath choose their own. It was so with the Deadhouse. <a class="calibre3"></a>Two men were chosen: one who would be Emperor, the other who would accompany him. Kellanved and Dancer.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I sense its power,” Orfantal whispered. “Our lord could destroy it, now, while it’s still young.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Yes,” agreed Korlat. “He could.” She was silent a moment, then she rose. “I am blood-kin to the fallen,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You are blood-kin,” the others intoned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“The quest for vengeance is ended,” Korlat said, the lines around her almond-shaped eyes tightening. “Our lord will not be summoned. Leave him to his recovery. The Azath will not be touched, for it is new, a child.” Her eyes, soft brown, slowly regarded those of her companions. “The Queen of Darkness spoke thus of Light when it was first born: ‘It is new, and what is new is innocent, and what is innocent is precious. Observe this child of wonder, and know respect.’ ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Orfantal scowled. “Thus did Light survive, and so was Darkness destroyed, the purity vanquished—and now you would have us flawed as our Queen was flawed. Light became corrupted and destroyed our world, Korlat, or have you forgotten?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Korlat’s smile was a sad one. “Cherish such flaws, dear brother, for our Queen’s was hope, and so is mine. Now we must leave.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe’s expression was benign as he watched Crokus approach, clearly exhausted by this night of endless running. He nudged Murillio and fluttered his fingers in the young thief’s direction. “The lad returns with undue haste, yet I fear such sad tidings as Kruppe must bring.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“He’s had a rough night all around,” Murillio commented. He leaned against the gate’s support wall outside the Simtal Estate. The streets remained empty, the citizens shocked numb with the night’s horrors.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe gestured at Moon’s Spawn, now a league to the west, well beyond the city’s walls. “A remarkable contraption, that. However, Kruppe is pleased that it has chosen to depart. Imagine, even the stars blotted out, leaving naught but dread in this world.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I need a drink,” Murillio muttered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Excellent idea,” Kruppe said. “Shall we await the lad, however?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The wait was not long. Crokus recognized them and slowed his frantic run. “Apsalar’s been kidnaped by the Empire!” he shouted. “I need help!” He wobbled to a halt before Murillio. “And Rallick’s still in the garden—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Tut, tut,” Kruppe said. “Easy, lad. Apsalar’s location is known to Kruppe. As for Rallick, well . . .” He faced the street and waved his arms expansively. “Breathe the night air, Crokus! A new year has begun! Come, let us walk, the three of us, masters of Darujhistan!” He linked arms with his comrades and pulled them forward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Murillio sighed. “Rallick’s missing,” he explained. “There’s some kind of extraordinary house in Coll’s garden now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>“Ah, so much unveiled in that single statement!” Kruppe leaned against Crokus. “While, no doubt, the lad’s secret, overriding concern at the moment regards the fate of a fair young maiden, whose life was saved at the last moment by a noble son named Gorlas, of all things. Saved, Kruppe says, from a ton of masonry shrugged off a wall. ’Twas heroic, indeed. The lass near-swooned with satisfaction.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“What are you talking about?” Crokus demanded. “Who was saved?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Murillio snorted. “I think, dear Kruppe, Master of Darujhistan, you’ve got the wrong fair maiden in mind.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“She’s not fair, anyway,” Crokus asserted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe’s chest swelled slightly. “You need but ask the gods, lad, and they’ll tell that life itself isn’t fair. Now, are you interested in how Lady Simtal’s estate has just this night become Coll’s estate? Or is your mind so thoroughly enamoured of this new love of yours that even the fates of your dearest friends—Kruppe included—yield such lack of interest?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus bridled. “Of course I’m interested!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Then the story begins, as always, with Kruppe . . .”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Murillio groaned. “Thus spake the Eel.”</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_94"></div></body>
