<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>“This isn’t right, Meese,” Crokus said, as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes. “We can’t just hide in here forever.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Apsalar said, from the window, “It’s almost dark.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Meese crouched once again to check the trapdoor’s lock. “We’re moving you again, after the twelfth bell. Irilta’s down below, getting details.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Who’s giving these orders?” Crokus demanded. “Have you found Uncle Mammot yet?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Relax, lad.” Meese straightened. “No, we ain’t found your uncle. And the orders come from your protectors. I won’t answer any questions about who they are, Crokus, so save your breath.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Apsalar shifted position by the window to take in Meese. “Your friend’s been a long time,” she said. “Do you think something’s happened?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Meese looked away. This girl was sharp. Of course, Meese had known that the first time they’d met, and old Chert had found out the hard way. “Not sure,” she admitted. She bent to unlock the trapdoor. “You both stay put,” she ordered, glaring at Crokus. “I ain’t going to be happy if you do something stupid. Understand?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The boy looked glum, his arms crossed. He watched as Meese opened the trapdoor and climbed down the ladder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Close this up after me,” she said, from below, “and lock it. Wait to hear from either me or Irilta, got it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Yes.” Crokus strode to the square hole in the floor and stared down at Meese. “We got it,” he said, grasping the door and swinging it shut. Then he locked it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Crokus,” Apsalar asked, “why did you kill a guard?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">This was their first time alone since entering the city. Crokus glanced away. “It was an accident. I don’t want to talk about it.” He crossed the room to the back window. “All these people trying to protect me,” he said. “Makes me uneasy. There’s more going on than just an order for my arrest. Hood’s Breath, the Thieves’ Guild takes care of such things, that’s why they get ten percent of every job I do. No, none of it makes sense, Apsalar. And,” he said, as he unlatched the window, “I’m sick of everybody telling me what to do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">She came to his side. “Are we leaving, then?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Damn right. It’s already dusk so we’ll take the rooftops.” He pulled and the window swung inward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Where?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus grinned. “I’ve got a great hiding-place in mind. Nobody will find us, not even my protectors. Once there, I can do what I want.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Apsalar’s brown eyes searched his face. “What do you want to do?” she asked softly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>He looked away, concentrating on propping up the window. “I want to talk to Challice D’Arle,” he said. “Face to face.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“She betrayed you, didn’t she?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Never mind that. Are you staying here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“No,” she said, surprised. “I’m coming with you, Crokus.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">The power of her Warren bristled on her body. Serrat scanned the area one more time, still seeing and sensing nothing. She was certain she was alone. The Tiste Andii tensed as the window in the attic beneath her creaked inward on rusty hinges. Knowing herself to be invisible, she leaned forward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The lad’s head popped out. He glanced at the alley below, the opposite rooftops and those to either side, then he looked up. His gaze passed right through Serrat, and she smiled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">It hadn’t taken long to find him again. His only company, she could sense, was a young woman whose aura was harmless, astonishingly innocent. The other two women no longer occupied the attic. Excellent. It would be that much easier. She stepped back as the Coin Bearer climbed through the window.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A moment later he scrambled onto the sloping rooftop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Serrat decided that she would waste no time. Even as the Coin Bearer pushed himself to his feet, she sprang forward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Her charge met an invisible hand, driving into her chest with bone-jarring force. It pushed her back through the air, giving a final shove that sent her cartwheeling beyond the roof’s edge. Her spells of invisibility and flight remained with her, even when she rebounded off a brick chimney, dazed and drifting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Apsalar appeared on the roof’s edge. Crokus crouched before her, daggers in hand and glaring all around him. “What’s wrong?” she whispered, frightened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Slowly, Crokus relaxed and turned a rueful grin her way. “Just nerves,” he said. “Thought I saw something, felt a wind. Looked like . . . Well, never mind.” He looked around again. “There’s nothing here. Come on, then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Where’s this new hiding-place of yours?” Aspalar asked, as she gained the rooftop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He faced east and pointed to the shadowed hills rising on the other side of the wall. “Up there,” he said. “Right under their very noses.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Murillio clasped on his sword-belt. The longer he waited for Rallick to arrive the more certain he was that Ocelot had killed his friend. The only question that remained was whether Coll still lived. Maybe Rallick had done enough, wounded Ocelot sufficiently to prevent the Clan Master from completing the contract. <em class="calibre11">I can hope, anyway</em>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">They’d know at the Phoenix Inn, and each minute that passed made his Spartan room seem smaller, more cramped. If Coll lived, Murillio vowed to attempt <a class="calibre3"></a>Rallick’s role in the plan. He checked his rapier. It’d been years since his last duel, and Turban Orr was said to be the city’s best. His chances looked poor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He collected his cape and fastened the collar around his neck. And who was this Circle Breaker with all the devastating news? How did this Eel justify involving himself or herself in their schemes? Murillio’s eyes narrowed. Was it possible? That little round runt of a man?</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He pulled on his doeskin gloves, muttering under his breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A scrape at the door caught his attention. A heavy sigh of relief escaped him. “Rallick, you old bastard,” he said, as he opened the door. For an instant he thought the hallway empty, then his gaze fell to the floor. The assassin lay there, his clothing soaked through with blood, looking up at him with a weak grin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Sorry I’m late,” he said. “My legs keep giving out.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Cursing, Murillio helped Rallick into the room and onto the bed. He returned to the door, checked the hallway, then shut and set the lock.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rallick pushed himself upright against the headboard. “Orr offered a contract on Coll—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I know, I know,” Murillio said, as he approached. He knelt beside the bed. “Let’s see to your wound.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I need to take off my armor first,” Rallick said. “Ocelot stuck me one. Then I killed him. Coll’s still alive as far as I know. What day is this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“The same day,” Murillio said, as he helped his friend remove his mail hauberk. “We’re still on schedule, though from all this blood it looks like you won’t be dueling Orr at Simtal’s Fête. I’ll handle that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Stupid idea.” Rallick groaned. “You’ll just get killed and Turban Orr will walk away, still Lady Simtal’s backer and still powerful enough to prevent Coll’s claim to rights.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Murillio made no reply to that. He peeled back the leather padding to expose the wound. “What’s with all this blood on you?” he demanded. “There’s nothing here but a week-old scar.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Huh?” Rallick probed the place where Ocelot’s wrist-blade had stabbed him. It felt mildly tender, itchy at the edges. “I’ll be damned,” he muttered. “Anyway, get me a washcloth, so I can clean all this rust off.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Murillio sat back on his haunches, clearly confused. “What rust?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“The stuff on my face,” Rallick said, scowling at his friend.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Murillio leaned close.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Baruk’s magic-deadening powder!” the assassin snapped. “How the hell do you think I managed to kill Ocelot?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Your face is clean, Rallick,” Murillio said. “You’re welcome to the washcloth. We’ll get all that dried blood off you in any case.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Give me a mirror first,” Rallick said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Murillio found one and stood watching Rallick study his own pallid reflection, which bore a deep frown. He observed dryly, “Well, that expression confirms it for me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Confirms what?” the assassin asked, in a dangerous tone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“That you’re you, Rallick.” Murillio squared his shoulders. “Rest here for a <a class="calibre3"></a>while. You’ve lost a lot of blood. I’m off to find the Eel and tell him a thing or two.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You know who the Eel is?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He strode to the door. “I’ve got a hunch. If you can walk, try locking this door behind me, will you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe mopped his brow with his limp, sodden handkerchief. “Kruppe has uttered every single detail at least a thousand times, Master Baruk,” he complained. “Will this ordeal never end? Look at yon window. A whole day in Kruppe’s life has passed!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The alchemist sat frowning down at his slippers, occasionally wiggling his toes, as the minutes passed. It was as if he’d forgotten Kruppe’s presence in the room, and it had been this way for the past hour, no matter how much Kruppe talked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Master Baruk,” Kruppe tried again, “may your loyal servant leave? He’s not yet recovered from his horrific journey in the eastern wastelands. Simple fare, of roast mutton, potatoes, fried onions and carrots, mussels in garlic butter, dates, cheese, smoked slipper minnows, and a carafe of wine, now occupies Kruppe’s mind to the exclusion of all else. Such as he has been reduced, his world contracting apace with his stomach—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk spoke. “For the past year,” he said slowly, “an agent of the Eel’s, known to me as Circle Breaker, has been providing me with vital information regarding the City Council.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe’s mouth shut with an audible click.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“It lies within my powers, of course, to identify this Circle Breaker at my leisure. I have a score of missives written in his own hand—the parchment alone suffices.” Baruk’s eyes lifted to fix on the mantelpiece. “I am considering doing so,” he said. “I must speak with this Eel. We’ve reached a critical juncture in the life of Darujhistan, and I must know the Eel’s purposes. We could work in close alliance, sharing all we know, and perhaps we can save the life of this city. Perhaps.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe cleared his throat and wiped his brow again. He carefully folded the handkerchief on his lap, then stuffed it into a sleeve. “If you wish to convey such a message,” he said quietly, “Kruppe can oblige Master Baruk.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk’s gaze dropped calmly to Kruppe. “Thank you. How soon the reply?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“By this evening,” Kruppe said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Excellent. I admit to resisting my own decision to compromise this Circle Breaker. The means you offer seem the best. You may go now, Kruppe.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe’s head bobbed. He rose. “Until tonight, then, Master Baruk.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Coll slept while the men in the room continued their discussion. Mallet said that the man might well sleep for days, Hood’s Gate having been as close as it was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran felt frustrated. Something was missing from Whiskeyjack’s explanations. <a class="calibre3"></a>The saboteurs had gone ahead with planting the mines, and even now it was Whiskeyjack’s plan to detonate them. More, the efforts to contact the Assassins’ Guild remained with the purpose of offering a contract on Darujhistan’s true rulers. These facts hardly complemented this idea of a full-scale, continent-wide revolt. If anything, wouldn’t Dujek be seeking local alliances?</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">As the sergeant went on, more and more of what the man said gathered in the captain’s mind, and he sensed a pattern emerging. He broke his hour-long silence and addressed Whiskeyjack. “You still intend to cripple Darujhistan. And I keep thinking about that, and now I think I’ve worked out why.” He studied Whiskeyjack’s blank expression. “What you seek is to crack this city wide open. Chaos in the streets, a headless government. Everybody who matters shows up and they kill each other. What does that leave?” Paran leaned forward, his eyes hard. “Dujek’s got an army ten thousand strong, about to become outlaws of the Empire. Maintaining ten thousand soldiers is an expensive business. Housing them is even tougher. Dujek knows Pale’s days are numbered. Caladan Brood’s on the march down the Rhivi Plain right now. Are the Moranth about to pull out of the alliance? Maybe make a move of their own? Tayschrenn’s in Pale—maybe old Onearm can handle him, maybe not. How am I so far, Sergeant?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Whiskeyjack glanced over at Kalam, then shrugged. “Go on,” he said to Paran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Darujhistan’s filled with panic. No one knows anything. In marches Dujek, rebel army at his heels. He’ll set things aright. Wealth beyond measure falls into his lap—and he’ll need all of it if he’s to oppose what the Empress sends after him. So, the city gets conquered after all. Fancy that.” He sat back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Not bad,” Whiskeyjack admitted, grinning at the surprise on the faces of Mallet and Kalam. “With one piece missing. Something,” he eyed Paran, “that might relieve the captain’s sense of betrayal, if not his outrage.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran’s smile was cold. “Surprise me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“All right, Captain. We don’t give a damn if the Empress wants to come after us. She won’t have much to do it with, since Seven Cities is days away from reclaiming its independence. It’s coming down, Captain. On all sides. So why do we maintain our army? Look to the south. Something’s growing there, so ugly it makes the Imass look like kittens. When I say we’re in trouble, I don’t mean just Genabackis, I mean the world. We’re all in for a fight, Captain. And that’s why we need Darujhistan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“What’s to the south?” Paran asked skeptically.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kalam answered, his words a breath of fear, “The Pannion Seer. So the rumors are true, then. The Seer’s proclaimed a holy war. The genocide’s begun.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Whiskeyjack got to his feet. “Explain it to the man,” he said to Kalam. “That Guild still needs contacting, if possible. Hood knows, we’ve made a show of ourselves at this bar. Might be what’s needed, though.” He looked to Paran. “Captain, I don’t think Adjunct Lorn should know you’re alive, do you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“No.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Can you stay here until I call for you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>Paran glanced at Kalam, then nodded</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Good. Mallet, let’s move.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">“We’ve lost at least two days,” Lorn pronounced, thankful for the day’s lingering heat. “These are thirsty horses.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Tool stood near the shattered barrow marker, watching the Adjunct ready her horses for the journey into Darujhistan. “How fares your wound, Adjunct?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Mostly healed,” she replied. “Otataral has that effect on me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“My task is finished,” the Imass said. “If it becomes your desire to accompany me after you have completed your mission, I will be found here for the next ten days. I wish to observe this Jaghut Tyrant—though it will not see me, nor will I interfere. My thoughts of success are with you, Adjunct.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Lorn climbed onto her horse and stared down at the Imass. “Fare well in your search, Onos T’oolan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“That name is past. I am now Tool.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">She grinned, then gathered the reins and kicked her mount forward, the packhorse trailing on its lead. Once the Finnest was out of her hands, she would focus her talents on discovering this Coin Bearer. Until now she had not allowed herself to think about Oponn. She had had too many other, more immediate concerns, like Sorry.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A strong sense of regret filled her at the loss of Captain Paran. That man would have made her task much easier, possibly even enjoyable. Though he’d been a dour man, getting grimmer by the minute, she had to admit that she had been attracted to him. There might have been something there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Well,” she sighed, as she urged her horse up a hillside, “dying’s never in anybody’s plans.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Tool’s estimation gave her two days at the most. Then the Jaghut would be fully awake, and free of the barrow. The Finnest would have to be securely in place long before then. She looked forward to her meeting with Sorry, and instinctively brushed a hand against her sword’s pommel. To kill a servant of Shadow, perhaps the Rope himself. The Empress’s pleasure at that would be immense.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">She realized that the doubts that had plagued her, borne on those dark wings of knowledge, now lay quiescent. An effect of her time in the barrow? More likely this acorn in her pocket. Or perhaps she’d moved unconsciously beyond them. <em class="calibre11">When the time for action comes, all doubts must be discarded</em>. An old Claw tenet. She knew herself well, and she knew how to control all that was within her. Years of training, discipline, loyalty, and duty. The virtues of a soldier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">She was ready for the mission, and with this realization the weight on her shoulders vanished. She urged her mount into a gallop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Crokus craned his head and squinted into the darkness above. “Right to the top,” he said. “We can see the whole city from there.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>Apsalar eyed the stairs dubiously. “It’s awfully dark,” she said. “Are you sure this tower is abandoned? I mean, my father told me stories about ghosts, undead monsters, and they always lived in ruined places.” She looked around with wide eyes. “Places just like this one.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus groaned. “The god K’rul’s been dead for thousands of years,” he said. “Besides, no one ever comes here, so what would all those monsters do with all that spare time? What would they eat? Tell me that! Stupid stories.” He walked to the foot of the spiral staircase. “Come on, the view’s worth it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">She watched Crokus climb upward and hurried to follow before he disappeared from sight. What at first seemed to be impenetrable darkness slowly faded to gray, and Apsalar was surprised to find herself able to discern even the minutest details. The first things she noticed were the soot-stained paintings on the wall to their left. Each stone panel was as wide as a single step, rising half a dozen feet in a jagged procession that mimicked the stairs. “Crokus,” she whispered, “there’s a story painted on this wall.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus snorted. “Don’t be ridiculous! You can’t even see your hand in front of your face in here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><em class="calibre11">I can’t?</em></span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He continued, “Wait till you get up top. Those clouds we saw should have cleared the moon by now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“There’s something wet on these steps,” Apsalar said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Run off from up top,” he explained, exasperated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“No, it isn’t,” she insisted. “It’s thick, and sticky.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus stopped above her. “Look, will you be quiet for a minute? We’re almost there.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">They emerged onto a platform bathed in the moon’s silver glow. Near one of the low walls Crokus saw a heap of cloth. “What’s that?” he wondered. “Looks like somebody’s been camping up here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Apsalar stifled a gasp. “That’s a dead man!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“What?” Crokus hissed. “Not another one!” He rushed to the huddled figure and crouched beside it. “Blessed Mowri, somebody’s stabbed him in the head.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“There’s a crossbow over here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He grunted. “An assassin. I saw one just like this killed here last week. There’s an assassin war going on. Just like I told Kruppe and Murillio.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Look at the moon,” Apsalar breathed, from the far side of the platform.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus shivered. She was still a cold one, at times. “Which one?” he asked, rising.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“The shining one, of course.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Feeling contrary, Crokus studied Moon’s Spawn instead. A faint reddish glow suffused it—something he’d not seen before. A worm of fear squirmed in his stomach. Then his eyes widened. Five massive winged shapes seemed to sweep down the Moon’s face, angling northeast. He blinked, and they were gone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Do you see its oceans?” Apsalar asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“What?” He turned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Its oceans. Grallin’s Sea. That’s the big one. The Lord of the Deep Waters living <a class="calibre3"></a>there is named Grallin. He tends vast, beautiful underwater gardens. Grallin will come down to us, one day, to our world. And he’ll gather his chosen and take them to his world. And we’ll live in those gardens, warmed by the deep fires, and our children will swim like dolphins, and we’ll be happy since there won’t be anymore wars, and no empires, and no swords and shields. Oh, Crokus, it’ll be wonderful, won’t it?”<a class="calibre3"></a></span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Her profile was in silhouette. He stared at her. “Of course,” he said quietly. “Why not?” And then that question repeated itself in his head for an entirely different reason. Why not?</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_80"></div></body>
