<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>Kneading his brow, Kruppe sat reading in Mammot’s study.</span></p>
<blockquote class="calibre34"><p class="calibre46"><span class="calibre7">     . . . and in the Calling Down to earth the God was Crippled, and so Chained in its place. In the Calling Down many lands were sundered by the God’s Fists, and things were born and things were released. Chained and Crippled was this God</span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre16"> </div>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe glanced up from the ancient tome and rolled his eyes. “Brevity, Kruppe prays for brevity!” He returned to the faded handwritten script.</span></p>
<blockquote class="calibre34"><p class="calibre46"><span class="calibre7">and it bred caution in the unveiling of its powers. The Crippled God bred caution but not well enough, for the powers of the earth came to it in the end. Chained was the Crippled God, and so Chained was it destroyed. And upon this barren plain that imprisoned the Crippled God many gathered to the deed. Hood, gray wanderer of Death, was among the gathering, as was Dessembrae, then Hood’s Warrior—though it was here and in this time that Dessembrae shattered the bonds Hood held upon him. Also among the gathering were</span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre16"> </div>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe groaned and flipped pages. The list seemed interminable, absurdly long. From this account he half expected to see his grandmother’s name among those listed. Finally, after three pages, he found the names he sought.</span></p>
<blockquote class="calibre34"><p class="calibre46"><span class="calibre7">and among those that came from the vaulted heavens of silver, the Tiste Andii, dwellers of Darkness in the Place before Light, Black Dragons numbering five, and in their league sailed red-winged Silanah, said to dwell among the Tiste Andii in their Fang of Darkness descending from the vaulted heavens of silver</span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre16"> </div>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe nodded, muttering to himself. A descending Fang of Darkness—Moon’s Spawn? Home to five Black Dragons and one Red Dragon? He shivered. How had Coll come upon this? True, the man hadn’t always been a drunken lout, but even his past station, lofty as it was, hadn’t been the scholarly kind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Who, then, had spoken through the old man’s wine-stained mouth?</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“That,” Kruppe sighed to himself, “shall have to wait its answer. The significance, however, of Coll’s bellowed claim lies in its evident truth, and as to how it pertains to the present situation.” He closed the book and rose to his feet. Behind him he heard footsteps.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I’ve brought you herbal tea,” the old man said, as he entered the closet-sized room. “Has <em class="calibre11">Alladart’s Realm Compendium</em> been beneficial, Kruppe?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Beneficial indeed,” Kruppe said, gratefully accepting the earthenware mug. <a class="calibre3"></a>“Kruppe has learned the value of modern language. Such long-lipped dribbles common to those ancient scholars are a curse Kruppe is thankful to find extinct in our time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Ah, ha,” the old man said, coughing slightly and looking away. “Well, do you mind if I ask what you were seeking?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe glanced up, the corners of his eyes crinkling slightly. “Not at all, Mammot. I thought to find mention of my grandmother’s name.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Mammot frowned, then nodded. “I see. Well, I’ll not inquire as to your luck, then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Please, do not,” Kruppe said, eyes widening. “Luck is such a dreadful companion these days, with all awry as all happens to be. But thank you for understanding Kruppe’s need for circumspection.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Not at all,” Mammot said, waving one hand. “I didn’t mean to—well, yes, I did. Curiosity, you understand. The intellectual kind.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe smiled beatifically and sipped tea.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Well,” Mammot said, “shall we return to the common room, then, and find respite before the hearth?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">They strode into the other chamber. Once seated, Kruppe stretched out his legs and leaned back. “How has your writing been coming along?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Slow,” Mammot answered, “as one would expect, of course.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">It seemed Mammot was working up to something, and so Kruppe waited, idly wiggling his toes. A minute passed, then the old man cleared his throat and spoke. “Kruppe, have you seen much of my dear nephew lately?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe raised his eyebrows. “Long ago,” he said, “Kruppe made a promise to a man, the man being a concerned uncle to a young boy who found the streets an exciting playground. Aye, the lad dreamed of sword-fights and dark deeds committed in alleys on behalf of princesses in disguise, or some such thing—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Mammot was nodding, his eyes closed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“—and to such promises Kruppe has availed of himself thoroughly, for he, too, loved the boy. And as with any endeavor, survival is measured in ability, and so did Kruppe take the lad under his silken wing, with some success, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Mammot smiled, still nodding.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“And so, to answer the uncle’s question. Indeed Kruppe has seen the lad.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Mammot leaned forward and fixed Kruppe with an intense gaze. “Have you seen anything odd in his actions? I mean, has he asked you any strange questions, made any requests?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe’s eyes narrowed. He paused to drink. “Bluntly, yes. For one, he sought the return of a fine cache of jewelry he acquired recently, for personal reasons—as he said. Personal reasons. Kruppe wondered then and wonders now, but the lad’s seeming sincerity, nay, focused intensity, struck Kruppe as laudable.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Agreed! Would you believe Crokus has now expressed an interest in formal education? I can’t understand it. The boy’s positively obsessed about something.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Perhaps, then, Kruppe should piece this together.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Thank you,” Mammot said, relieved. “I would know where all this is coming <a class="calibre3"></a>from. So much ambition all at once, I fear it may soon burn itself out. If we can nourish it, however . . .”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“By all means,” Kruppe said. “There is more to life than petty thievery, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Mammot grinned. “Why, Kruppe, I’m surprised to hear that coming from you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Such comments are better left between you and Kruppe. In any case, I believe Murillio knows something of all this. He intimated as much this evening while we dined at the Phoenix Inn.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Mammot asked, “Is Murillio well?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe smiled. “The net about the lad remains intact,” he said. “For one, Rallick Nom has taken the responsibility seriously indeed. Mayhap he sees something of his own lost youth in Crokus. In truth, Rallick is a man whose true nature escapes Kruppe. Fiercely loyal for certain, and one who, as you well know, honors his debts with such vigor as to humble those around him. Excepting Kruppe, naturally. Yet is it blood that travels his veins? One must wonder, at times.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A distant look had entered Mammot’s face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe tensed. The air smelled of magic. He leaned forward and studied the old man seated across from him. Someone was communicating with Mammot, and the Warren that now pulsed in the room was familiar to Kruppe.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He sat back and waited.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Eventually, Mammot got swiftly to his feet. “I have some research to do,” he said distractedly. “As for you, Kruppe, Master Baruk wishes to speak with you immediately.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I thought I sensed the alchemist’s presence,” Kruppe said, rising with a soft grunt. “Ah, the rigors of these fated nights ever urge us on. Until later, then, Mammot.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Good-bye,” the scholar said, a frown on his face as he crossed the room. He entered the small chamber where Kruppe had spent the past hour.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe adjusted the sleeves of his cloak. Whatever had happened, it had been enough to jar Mammot’s etiquette, and that alone hinted at dire events. “Well,” he murmured, “best not keep Baruk waiting, then. At least,” he amended, as he headed for the door, “not for too long. Decorum demands that Kruppe retain his sense of dignity. He shall walk fast, yes. But walk he shall, for Kruppe needs time to think, to plan, to scheme, to anticipate, to backtrack with some thoughts, to leap ahead with others, to do all the things necessary. First and foremost, Kruppe must discern the nature of the woman who followed him, and who killed Chert, and who noted that Crokus saw the blood on her weapon, and who marked Rallick Nom as an assassin with his very arrival. She might well provide the key to everything, and more, for the Coin did indeed turn its face upon her, if only for a moment. And that, thinks Kruppe, shall return to us all, for good or ill.” He stopped and looked around, blinking rapidly. “At the very least,” he muttered, “Kruppe should leave Mammot’s room.” He glanced back at the chamber Mammot had entered. From within came the sounds of brittle pages being rapidly turned. Kruppe sighed in relief, then left.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>_______</span></p><div class="calibre5"> </div>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Crone ruffled her singed feathers and hopped about in agitation. Where was that alchemist? She had a thousand things to attend to before the night was done, though in truth she couldn’t think of any of them. Nevertheless, she disliked being kept waiting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The door to the study opened and Baruk strode through, gathering a robe about his considerable bulk. “My apologies, Crone, I was otherwise indisposed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crone grunted. Sorcery trailed from the man in thick, pungent streams. “My master, Lord Anomander Rake,” she said, without preamble, “has commanded that I tell you what I told him of my adventures on the Rhivi Plain.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk came up to where the Great Raven paced on the map table. The alchemist frowned. “You’ve been injured.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Pride, no more. Hearken then to my story.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk raised an eyebrow. The old witch’s mood was dark. He fell silent and she began.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“A small wooden puppet approaches from the north, a creation of soulshifting and sourced from a Warren of Chaos. Its power is immense, twisted, malign even to Great Ravens. It killed many of my kin as it slipped in and out of its Warren. It evidently took pleasure in such acts.” Crone snapped her beak in anger, then continued, “It pursues a power I could not approach, and whatever this power, it strikes directly for the Gadrobi Hills—my lord and I are agreed in this. The power seeks something within those hills, yet we are not native to this land. Hence we bring this news to you, Alchemist. Two forces are converging on the Gadrobi Hills. My lord asks you why.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk’s face had lost all its color. He turned slowly and walked to a chair. Sitting down, he steepled his hands before his face and closed his eyes. “The Malazan Empire seeks something it cannot hope to control, something buried within the Gadrobi Hills. Whether or not either force is capable of freeing that thing is another matter. Seeking is not the same as finding, and finding is not the same as succeeding.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crone hissed impatiently. “Who is buried there, Alchemist?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“A Jaghut Tyrant, imprisoned by the Jaghut themselves. Generations of scholars and sorcerers have sought to find this barrow. None managed to discover even so much as a clue.” Baruk looked up, his expression lined with worry. “I know of one man, here in Darujhistan, who has gathered all the available knowledge concerning this burial place. I must confer with him. I can give your lord this, however. There lies a standing stone in the Gadrobi Hills—I know its location precisely. It is almost invisible, only its weathered top breaks the ground, perhaps a hand’s span in height. The remaining twenty feet are beneath the earth. You will see the remnants of many pits and trenches that have been excavated around it—all fruitless. For while the stone marks the beginning point, it is not the entrance to the barrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Where, then, is this entrance?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“That I will not tell you. Once I speak with my colleague, perhaps I can give <a class="calibre3"></a>you more details. Perhaps not. But the means by which the barrow is entered must remain a secret.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“This avails us nothing! My lord—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Is extremely powerful,” Baruk cut in. “His intentions are anything but clear, Crone, no matter that we are allied. What lies within that barrow can destroy a city—this city. That I will not allow to enter Rake’s hands. You shall have the location of the standing stone, for it is there that the hunters must first go. I have one question to ask, Crone. This puppet, are you certain it pursues this other power?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crone bobbed her head. “It tracks. It hides when necessary. You assume both powers are Malazan. Why?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk grunted. “First, they want Darujhistan. They’ll do anything to win it. They’ve had access to vast libraries among the lands they’ve conquered. The Jaghut barrow is no secret in and of itself. Second, you said both powers came down from the north. They can only be Malazan. Why one hides from the other is beyond me, though I wouldn’t doubt that there are competing factions within the Empire—any political entity as large as that one is bound to be rife with discord. In any case, they pose a direct threat to Darujhistan and, by extension, to your lord’s desires to prevent the Malazan Empire from conquering us. Assuming that the powers are Malazan seems warranted.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crone’s displeasure was obvious. “You will be kept informed of the activities on the Rhivi Plain. My lord must decide whether to intercept these powers before they reach the Gadrobi Hills.” She turned an angry eye on Baruk. “He has received little assistance from his allies. I trust when we next speak that situation will be remedied.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The alchemist shrugged. “My first meeting with Anomander Rake has proved my only meeting with him. Assistance demands communication.” His tone hardened. “Inform your lord that the present dissatisfaction exists with us as much as it does with him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“My lord has been busy with his side of things,” Crone muttered, flapping to the windowsill.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk stared at the bird as she prepared to leave. “Busy?” he asked darkly. “In what way?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“In due time, Alchemist,” Crone purred. A moment later she was gone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk cursed, and with an angry gesture returned the window to its place and slammed the shutters. Doing this through magic and from a distance was not as satisfying as it would have been had he done it physically. Grumbling, he rose and walked to the mantelpiece. As he poured himself some wine, he paused. Less than half an hour ago he’d conjured a demon. It was not an ambitious conjuring: he’d needed a spy, not a killer. Something told him he’d be calling upon far dead-lier creatures in the near future. He scowled, then took a mouthful of wine. “Mammot,” he whispered, as he opened his Warren, “I need you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He smiled as a scene appeared in his head, of a small room and a stone hearth. Seated in the chair opposite his point of view was Kruppe. “Good. I need you both.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>_______</span></p><div class="calibre5"> </div>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">The Hound that approached Quick Ben was wide and heavy, its fur a pasty white. As it trotted up to the wizard, he saw that its eyes were also white. The creature possessed no pupils. It stopped a short distance away and sat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben bowed. “You are the Hound called Blind,” he said, “mate to Baran and mother of Gear. I come seeking no harm. I would speak with your master.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He heard a growl beside him and froze. Slowly, he turned his head and looked down. Less than a foot from his right leg lay another Hound, mottled brown and tan, lean and scarred. Its eyes were fixed on Blind. “Baran.” He nodded. Another growl answered Baran’s, this one behind the wizard. He turned further to see, ten feet away, a third Hound, this one long, black and sleek. Its eyes, fixed on him, glowed red. “And Shan,” he said quietly. He faced Blind again. “Have you found your quarry, or are you my escort?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baran rose silently beside him, its shoulders level with his chest. Blind stood, then trotted off to the left. She stopped and looked back. Twin growls spurred Quick Ben after them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The land around them changed slowly, details slipping into sourceless shadows and re-emerging subtly altered. On what the wizard thought of as the north horizon, a gray forest climbed a slope to what might have been a wall. This wall was in place of sky—maybe it <em class="calibre11">was</em> sky—but to Quick Ben it looked strangely close, even though the forest was leagues away. Glancing overhead did not help him confirm or refute his feeling that this realm was bordered by a magical wall, for it, too, seemed close, almost within reach. Yet black clouds rode winds above him, skewing his perceptions and making him dizzy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Another Hound had joined their company. This one, a male, was dark gray, one of its eyes blue, the other yellow. Though it didn’t come close, Quick Ben judged that it was the largest of those around him, and its movement hinted at deadly speed. He knew it as Doan, firstborn to the pack’s leader, Rood, and its first mate, Pallick.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Doan trotted alongside Blind for a time, then, when they came to the crest of a low rise, he bolted forward. Reaching the crest, Quick Ben saw their destination. He sighed. Just as the image carved upon the altar within the temples dedicated to Shadowthrone, Shadowkeep rose from the plain like an enormous lump of black glass, fractured with curving planes, rippled in places, with some corners glistening white as if crushed. The largest surface facing them—a wall, he supposed—was mottled and dull, as if it was a cortex, the weathered surface of obsidian.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">There were no windows as such, but many of the slick surfaces looked semi-translucent and seemed to glow with an inner light. As far as Quick Ben could see, there was no door, no gate, no drawbridge.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">They arrived, and the wizard exclaimed in surprise as Blind strode into the stone and disappeared. He hesitated, and Baran came as close to nudging him as Quick Ben allowed. He walked up to the mottled stone and held out his hands as he stepped into it. He felt nothing, passing through effortlessly to find himself in a hallway that could have been found in any mundane estate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>Barren of trappings, the corridor led straight forward for, perhaps, thirty feet and ended at double doors. Blind and Doan sat to either side of these doors, which now opened of their own accord.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben entered the room beyond. The chamber was domed. Opposite him stood a simple obsidian throne on a slightly raised dais. The dull, cobbled floor bore no rugs, and the walls were bare except for torches spaced every ten feet. Quick Ben counted forty, but the light was fitful, seeming to struggle against encroaching shadows.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">At first he thought the throne unoccupied, but as he approached he saw the figure seated there. It seemed composed of almost translucent shadows, vaguely human in form, but hooded, preventing even the glint of eyes. Still, Quick Ben could feel the god’s attention fixed solely on him, and he barely repressed a shiver.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Shadowthrone spoke, his voice calm and clear. “Shan tells me you know the names of my Hounds.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben stopped before the dais. He bowed. “I was once an acolyte within your temple, Lord.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The god was silent for a time, then he said, “Is it wise to admit such a thing, Wizard? Do I look kindly upon those who once served me but then abandoned my ways? Tell me. I would hear from you what my priests teach.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“To begin upon the Path of Shadow and then to leave it is rewarded by the Rope.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Meaning?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I am marked for assassination by all who follow your ways, Lord.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Yet here you stand, Wizard.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben bowed again. “I would strike a deal, Lord.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The god giggled, then raised a hand. “No, dear Shan. Strike naught.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben stiffened. The black Hound stepped around him, and ascended the dais. She lay down before her god and eyed the wizard blankly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Do you know why I just saved your life, Wizard?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I do, Lord.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Shadowthrone leaned forward. “Shan wants you to tell me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben met the Hound’s red stare. “Shadowthrone loves deals.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The god sighed and sank back. “Acolyte, indeed. Well, then, Wizard, speak on, while you can.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I must begin with a question, Lord.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Ask it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Does Gear still live?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Shan’s eyes flared and she half rose before the god’s hand touched her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Now that,” Shadowthrone said, “is quite a question. You’ve managed something few, alas, have been able to do. Wizard, my curiosity is piqued. So, I answer you: yes, Gear survives. By all means, continue.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Lord, I would deliver into your hands the one who offended your Hound.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“How? He belongs to Oponn.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Not him, Lord. But the one who led Gear to that chamber. The one who sought to take Gear’s soul, and would have succeeded if not for Oponn’s mortal tool.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>“In exchange for what?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben cursed inwardly. He could read nothing from the god’s tone, and that made things even trickier than he’d expected. “My life, Lord. I wish the Rope’s reward lifted from me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Anything else?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Yes.” He hesitated, then continued, “I wish to choose the time and place, Lord. Otherwise, this one of whom I speak will escape your Hounds through its Warren of Chaos. Only I can prevent that. Thus, it must be part of the deal. All that you need do is have your Hounds ready. I will call upon you at the proper moment, providing you with the creature’s precise location. The rest is up to your Hounds.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You’ve planned this well, Wizard,” Shadowthrone said. “As of yet, I can think of no way to kill both the creature and you. I commend you. How then, do you intend to call upon me? Surely, you’ll not once again enter my realm.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Lord, you will be contacted. I guarantee this, but I can say no more about it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“And if I were to lay my powers upon you now, Wizard? If I were to wring whatever lies hidden in that frail brain of yours, how would you prevent me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“To answer that, Lord, you must answer my proposal first.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Shan growled and this time the god made no motion to still her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben went on hastily, “Given that you will seek to betray me at every opportunity, given that you’ll hunt for the weaknesses in my plan, given all this, I would have your word that you will complete your part of the deal if all else fails you, Lord. Give me that, and I will answer your last question.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Shadowthrone was silent for a long minute. “Ah well,” he muttered. “Your cunning is admirable, Wizard. I am astonished and, I must admit, delighted by this duel. My only regret is that you departed the Paths of Shadow—you would have risen far. Very well. You have my word. The Hounds will be ready. Now, why shouldn’t I shred your brain here and now, Wizard?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Your answer, Lord, is in your very words.” Quick Ben raised his arms. “I did indeed rise far, Shadowthrone, in service to you.” He opened his Warren. “You’ll not have me, Lord, because you can’t.” Quick Ben whispered his word of recall, a word born of Chaos. Power burst around him, and he felt as if a giant hand had closed around him. As it pulled him back into his Warren, he heard Shadowthrone’s scream of recognition.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“It is you! Delat! You shape-shifting bastard!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben smiled. He’d done it. He was out of reach. He’d done it—again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe was ushered into Baruk’s study with none of the delays he was so fond of confounding. Slightly disappointed, he took his seat and wiped his forehead with his handkerchief.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk entered. “You took your time getting here,” he growled. “Well, never mind. Have you any news?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe laid his handkerchief on his lap and began carefully to fold it. “We continue to protect the Coin Bearer, as instructed. As for the presence of Malazan infiltrators, no luck.” It was a major lie, but necessary. “I am to convey <a class="calibre3"></a>a message to you,” he continued, “most unusual in its source. Indeed, strange in fact was its delivery to Kruppe.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Get on with it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe winced. Baruk was in a terrible mood. He sighed. “A message to you personally, Master.” He completed folding his handkerchief and looked up. “From the Eel.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk stiffened, then a scowl darkened his features. “Why not?” he muttered. “The man even knows who my agents are.” His gaze cleared and he watched Kruppe. “I’m waiting,” he growled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Of course!” Kruppe shook loose his handkerchief and mopped his brow. “‘Look to the streets to find those you seek.’ That, and no more. Delivered to Kruppe by the smallest child he’d ever seen—” He stopped and shook his head. No, such exaggeration would never do, not with Baruk’s mood as foul as it appeared to be. “A small child, in any case.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk stood glowering at the dying embers in the fireplace, his hands clasped behind his back, fingers twisting a large silver ring. “Tell me, Kruppe,” he asked slowly, “what do you know of this Eel?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Little, Kruppe admits. Man, woman? Unknown. Origins? A mystery. Designs? Perpetuating a status quo defined by aversion to tyranny. Or so it’s said. Influence? Far-reaching; even if one discounts nine out of ten rumors associated with the Eel, his or her agents must number in the hundreds. All devoted to protecting Darujhistan. ’Tis said that Councilman Turban Orr is even now hunting them down, convinced they’ve ruined all his schemes. Mayhap they have, and for that we can all be relieved.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk seemed anything but relieved. Kruppe thought he could almost hear the man’s teeth grinding. However, he turned to Kruppe and nodded. “I have an assignment. For it, you will need to round up Murillio, Rallick, and Coll. And take the Coin Bearer with you, just to keep him safe.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe raised an eyebrow. “Out of the city?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Yes. Paramount is the Coin Bearer—keep him beyond anyone’s reach. As for your mission, you will observe. Nothing more. Do you understand me, Kruppe? Observe. To do anything else will be to risk the Coin Bearer falling into the wrong hands. While he is Oponn’s tool, he also is the means by which another Ascendant can reach Oponn. The last thing we need is gods battling on the mortal plain.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe cleared his throat. “What are we to observe, Master?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I’m not sure, possibly a foreign work party, digging here and there.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe started. “As in . . . road repairs?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The alchemist frowned. “I will be sending you to the Gadrobi Hills. Remain there until either someone comes or I contact you with further instructions. If someone comes, Kruppe, you’re to remain hidden. Avoid detection at all costs—use your Warren, if need be.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“None shall find Kruppe and his worthy, loyal comrades,” Kruppe said, smiling and waggling his fingers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Good. That will be all, then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Surprised, Kruppe climbed to his feet. “When are we to leave, Master?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>“Soon. I’ll let you know at least a day beforehand. Is that sufficient time?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Yes, friend Baruk. Kruppe deems that more than enough time. Rallick appears temporarily indisposed, but with luck he shall be available.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Get him if you can. If the Coin Bearer’s influence turns against us, the assassin is charged with killing the boy. Does he understand this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“We’ve discussed it,” Kruppe said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Baruk inclined his head and fell silent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kruppe waited a moment, then quietly left.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Less than an hour after Quick Ben’s soul had left the body seated on the hut’s floor and journeyed into the Shadow Realm, it creaked back into life. Red-eyed with an exhaustion born of unrelenting tension, Kalam pushed himself to his feet and waited for his friend to come round.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The assassin laid his hands on his long-knives, just to be on the safe side. If Quick Ben had been taken, whatever controlled him might well announce its arrival by attacking anyone within range. Kalam held his breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The wizard’s eyes opened, the glaze slipping away as awareness returned. He saw Kalam, and smiled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The assassin released his breath. “Done? Success?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Yes, on both counts. Hard to believe, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kalam found he was grinning uncontrollably. He stepped forward and helped Quick Ben to stand. The wizard leaned heavily against him, also grinning.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“He realized who I was just as I left.” Quick Ben’s grin broadened. “You should have heard him scream.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Well, are you surprised? How many High Priests burn the robes of their vestment?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Not enough, if you ask me. Without temples and priests the gods’ bloody meddling couldn’t touch the mortal realm. Now, that would be paradise, right, friend?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Perhaps,” said a voice at the doorway. Both men turned to see Sorry standing within the entrance, her half-cloak drawn about her slim body. She was wet with rain, and only now did Kalam notice the water dripping through cracks all around them. The assassin stepped away from Quick Ben to free his hands. “What are you doing here?” he demanded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You dream of paradise, Wizard? I wish I’d heard the entire conversation.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“How did you find us?” Quick Ben asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Sorry stepped inside and pushed back her hood. “I’ve found an assassin,” she said. “I’ve marked him. He is in a place called the Phoenix Inn, in the Daru District. Are you interested?” she asked, dully eyeing both men.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I want answers,” Kalam said, in a low voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben backed to the far wall, to give the assassin room and to prepare his spells if need be—though he was in no real shape to manage his Warren at the moment. Nor, he noticed, did Kalam look up to a scrap, not that the assassin would allow that to stop him. Right now, he was at his most dangerous—that low tone had said it all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>Sorry held her dead eyes on Kalam. “The sergeant has sent me to you—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“A lie,” Kalam interjected softly. “Whiskeyjack doesn’t know where we are.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Very well. I sensed your power, Wizard. It has a notable signature.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben was stunned. “But I established a shield around this place,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Yes. I, too, was surprised, Wizard. Usually I cannot find you. It seems cracks appeared.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben thought about that. “Cracks,” he decided, wasn’t the right word—but Sorry didn’t know that. She’d sensed his whereabouts because she was what they’d suspected, a pawn of the Rope. The Shadow Realm had been linked, however briefly and however tenuously, to his flesh and blood. Yet none but a servant of Shadow possessed the necessary sensitivity to detect that link. The wizard moved to stand beside Kalam and laid a hand on the burly man’s shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kalam threw him a startled glare.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“She’s right. Cracks appeared, Kalam. She’s obviously a natural Talent in the ways of sorcery. Come on, friend, the girl’s found what we’ve been looking for. Let’s move on it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Sorry pulled up the hood around her head. “I am not accompanying you,” she said. “You’ll know the man when you see him. I suspect it is his task to make his profession obvious. Perhaps the Guild is anticipating you. In any case, find the Phoenix Inn.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“What the hell are you up to?” Kalam demanded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I will be completing an assignment for the sergeant.” She turned and left the hut.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kalam’s shoulders slumped and he let out a long breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“She’s the one we thought her to be,” Quick Ben said quietly. “So far, so good.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“In other words,” the assassin growled, “if I’d attacked her I’d be a dead man right now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Exactly. We’ll take her out, when the time’s right. But for now we need her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kalam nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Phoenix Inn?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Damn right. And when we get there the first thing I’m doing is buying a drink.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben smiled. “Agreed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Rallick looked up as the heavyset man entered the bar. His black skin marked him a southerner, which in itself was not unusual. What caught Rallick’s attention, however, was the horn-handled, silver-pommeled long-knives tucked into the man’s narrow belt. Those weapons were anything but southern, and stamped on the pommels was a cross-hatched pattern, recognizable to all within the trade as the mark of an assassin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The man swaggered into the room as if he owned it, and none of the locals he shouldered aside seemed inclined to disagree with him. He reached the bar and ordered an ale.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rallick studied the dregs in his own tankard. Obviously the man wanted to <a class="calibre3"></a>be marked, precisely by someone like Rallick Nom, a Guild assassin. So, who was the bait, then? This didn’t fit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Ocelot, his Clan Leader, was convinced, along with everyone else in the Guild, that Empire Claws had come into the city and now waged war against them. Rallick wasn’t so sure. The man standing at the bar could as easily be Seven Cities as a traveler from Callows. He had the look of Malazan Empire about him. Was he Claw? If so, why show himself? Up until now the enemy hadn’t left a single clue, or a single eyewitness, as to their identity. The brazenness he now observed either didn’t fit, or marked a reversal of tactics. Had Vorcan’s order to go to ground triggered it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Alarm bells rang in Rallick’s head. None of this felt right.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Murillio leaned close to him. “Something wrong, friend?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Guild business,” Rallick replied. “You thirsty?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Murillio grinned. “An offer I can’t refuse.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">After a single, bemused glance at Coll’s unconscious form, slumped in the chair, the assassin left the table. What <em class="calibre11">had</em> all that been about five black dragons? He made his way to the bar. As he pushed through the crowd, he gave one youth a hard elbow to the back. The boy gasped, then surreptitiously slipped toward the kitchen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rallick arrived, called Scurve over, then ordered another pitcher. Though he did not look the man’s way, he knew he’d been marked by him. It was no more than a feeling, but one he’d learned to trust. He sighed as Scurve delivered the foaming pitcher. Well, he’d done what Ocelot had demanded of him, though he suspected his Clan Leader would be asking for more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He returned to the table and conversed with Murillio for a time, plying his friend with the majority of the ale. Murillio sensed a growing tension around Rallick and took his cue. He drained the last of his drink and rose. “Well,” he said, “Kruppe’s scurried off, Crokus too. And Coll’s once again dead to the world. Rallick, I thank you for the ale. Time to find a warm bed. Until the morrow, then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rallick remained seated for another five minutes, only once brushing gazes with the black man leaning against the bar. Then he rose and strode into the kitchen. The two cooks rolled their eyes at each other as he strode past. Rallick ignored them. He came to the door, which had been left ajar in hopes of a cooling draft. The alley beyond was wet, though the rain had passed. From a shadowed recess on the wall opposite the inn stepped a familiar figure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rallick walked up to Ocelot. “It’s done. Your man is the big black one nursing an ale. Two daggers, hatch-marked. He looks mean and not one I’d like to tussle with. He’s all yours, Ocelot.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The man’s pocked face twisted. “He’s still inside? Good. Head back in. Make sure you’ve been noticed—damn sure, Nom.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rallick crossed his arms. “I’m sure already,” he drawled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You’re to draw him out, lead him into Tarlow’s warehouse—into the loading grounds.” Ocelot sneered. “Vorcan’s orders, Nom. And when you head out, do it by the front door. No mistakes, nothing subtle.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>“The man’s an assassin,” Rallick grated. “If I’m not subtle he’ll know it’s a trap and crawl all over me in seconds flat.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You do as Vorcan wills, Nom. Now get back inside!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rallick stared at his commander, to make his disgust plain, then returned to the kitchen. The cooks grinned at him, but only for a moment. One look at Rallick’s face was enough to kill any humor in the room. They bent to their tasks as if prodded by a landmaster.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rallick entered the main room, then stopped dead in his tracks. “Damn,” he muttered. The black man was gone. Now what? He shrugged. “Front door it is.” He made his way through the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">In an alley, on one side of which ran a high stone wall, Crokus leaned against the damp bricks of a merchant’s house and gazed steadily at a window. It was on the third floor, beyond the wall, and behind its shuttered face was a room he knew intimately.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">There’d been a light on inside for most of the two hours he’d stood below, but for the last fifteen minutes the room within had been dark. Numb with exhaustion and plagued with doubts, Crokus pulled his cloak tighter around him. He wondered what he was doing here, and not for the first time. All his resolve seemed to have drained into the gutters along with the rain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Had it been the dark-haired woman in the Phoenix Inn? Had she rattled him that much? The blood on her dagger made it obvious that she wouldn’t hesitate to kill him just to keep her secret intact. Maybe it was the spinning coin that had him so confused. Nothing about that incident had been natural.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">What was so wrong with his dream of being introduced to the D’Arle maiden? It had nothing to do with that killer woman in the bar.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Nothing,” he mumbled, then scowled. Now he was talking aloud to himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A thought came to him that deepened his scowl. Everything had begun its mad unraveling the night he’d robbed the maiden. If only he hadn’t paused, if only he hadn’t looked upon her soft, round, lovely face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A groan escaped him, and he shifted his feet. A high-born. That was the real problem, wasn’t it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">It all seemed so stupid now, so absurd. How could he have convinced himself that such a thing as meeting her was possible? He shook himself. It didn’t matter, he’d planned this, now it was time to do it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I don’t believe this,” he muttered as he pushed himself from the wall and headed down the alley. His hand brushed the pouch tied to his waist. “I’m about to put a maiden’s ransom back.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He came to the stone wall he’d been looking for, and began to climb. He drew a deep breath. <em class="calibre11">All right, let’s get it done</em>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The stone was wet, but he had enough determination in him to scale a mountain. He climbed on, and did not slip even so much as a single foothold.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_58"></div></body>
