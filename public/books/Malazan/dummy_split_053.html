<p class="calibre36"> </p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>Quick Ben sat in the hut, his back to the ancient stone tier Wall. Before him rose the five sticks that linked him with Hairlock. The string connecting the sticks was taut. Across from the wizard, near the hide-covered entrance, sat Trotts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kalam had still not recovered enough to accompany Quick Ben, or to guard him as Trotts now did. The wizard had known the Barghast warrior for years, he’d fought alongside him in more battles than he cared to recall, and more than once one of them had saved the other’s skin. And yet Quick Ben realized he really knew very little about Trotts. The one thing he did know, however, comforted him. The Barghast was a savage, brutal fighter, as capable with his throwing axes as he was with the longsword he now cradled in his lap. And he was fearless in the face of sorcery, secure in the fetishes tied into his braids, and in the woad tattoos inscribed by the hand of his clan’s shaman.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Considering what might fall into their laps, those protections could come in handy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Barghast stared at the wizard with flat, expressionless eyes, unwavering in the dim light.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben shook out the kinks in his hands, then bent forward to study the array of tied sticks. “Hairlock’s crouching inside his Warren,” he said. “Not moving. Seems to be waiting.” He sat back and withdrew his dagger, which he jammed point first into the packed earth. “So we wait, too. And watch.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Trotts asked, “Watch what?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Never mind.” Quick Ben sighed. “You have that scrap of bedroll?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Trotts removed from a sleeve a torn piece of cloth. He came forward, giving the sticks more room than was necessary, and pushed the scrap into the wizard’s hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben set it down on his left. He muttered a few words and passed his hand over it. “Resume your seat,” he said. “And keep your weapon ready in case things go bad.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He closed his eyes then, reaching into his Warren. Before him an image formed that made him jerk with surprise. “What,” he whispered, “is Hairlock doing on Rhivi Plain?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Paran could feel nothing but the white fire of vengeance, filling his mind, coruscating through his body. Oponn had chosen to use him. Now he would use Oponn, the Twins’ power, that horrifying edge of destruction that came with Ascendancy. And like the gods, he could be cold-blooded in that use, even if it <a class="calibre3"></a>meant pulling Oponn kicking and screaming onto this plain to face whatever lay ahead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A hiss of warning that might have been his conscience reached through to him. Toc the Younger was his friend, perhaps the only friend he had. Unprotected by any god, his chance of surviving what was coming was slim. Would there be another death to lay at his feet? Paran pushed aside the possibility. He was here to answer for Tattersail’s murder. The Adjunct had taught him the value of being singleminded. <em class="calibre11">But what did Tattersail teach you?</em></span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“If things get too hot,” he said, “pull out, Toc. Ride for Darujhistan. Find Whiskeyjack.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The scout nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“If I go down—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I heard you, Captain.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Good.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Silence fell between them, the only sounds remaining the thump of hooves and the hot west wind that blew like sand whispering across stone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Vague anticipations crowded Paran’s head. Was the Adjunct waiting for them? If she recognized him and Toc, she’d have no reason to attack them. For all she knew, the captain had been killed. And Toc was a Claw. There’d be no ambush. The Adjunct would simply step out into the open and hail him, no doubt shocked by his appearance but hardly suspicious.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">And when she came close, Chance would sing. It would be done, and if necessary they’d deal with the Imass afterward. He hoped that the Imass would simply leave with the mission’s collapse. Without the Adjunct, everything would fall through.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">At least, so he hoped. Chance might be a gifted sword, but the T’lan Imass were Elder creations, born of sorceries that made Oponn less than a child.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran’s grip on the sword’s handle was tight. His hand ached, and he could feel sweat between his fingers. Chance felt no different from any other weapon. Should he be expecting something more? He couldn’t recall much of the time he’d last used it, against the Hound. But if there was power in the weapon, should he not be able to sense it? As it was, Chance felt cold, as if he clutched a shard of ice that refused to melt in his grip. If anything, Chance felt awkward, as if he was a novice and held it wrongly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">What had triggered this sudden crumpling of confidence? <em class="calibre11">Pulling an Ascendant into the fray . . . how precisely do I do that? Of course, if Oponn’s as eager as last time</em> . . . Maybe it was no more than just the tension that came with waiting for something to happen. Was Toc mistaken? He turned to the man beside him and opened his mouth to speak.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A loud, manic cackle stopped him. Paran pulled savagely on the reins. His horse screamed and reared. The air seemed to rip and a cold wind gusted against them. The captain raised his sword and cursed. The horse screamed again, this time in pain. It crumpled beneath him, as if its bones had been turned to dust. Paran sprawled, the sword flying from his hand as the ground rose up to meet <a class="calibre3"></a>him. The horse’s fall had the sound of a bag filled with rocks and lamp oil, landing beside him and rolling over his legs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Toc’s bowstring twanged and an arrow shattered against something hard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran pushed himself onto his side and looked up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The puppet Hairlock floated above the ground twenty feet ahead. A second arrow struck as the captain watched, also shattering.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Hairlock laughed again, swinging his mad stare to Toc. He gestured.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran cried out, twisting to see Toc thrown from his mount. The Claw cartwheeled through the air. A jagged tear opened in the air in front of him. Paran shouted a second time in helpless horror as Toc the Younger plunged into that tear and disappeared into swirling mists. The rent closed with a snap, leaving no sign of Paran’s companion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Hairlock descended slowly to the ground. The puppet paused to adjust his tattered clothing, then strode toward Paran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I thought it might be you,” Hairlock sniggered. “Isn’t vengeance sweeter than honey, eh, Captain? Your death will be long, protracted, and very, very painful. Imagine my pleasure at seeing you like this!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran pushed with his legs. The horse’s body fell back, freeing him. He scrambled to his feet and dived for his sword, grasping it while rolling, then regained his feet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Hairlock watched in evident amusement and began to advance. “That weapon is not for me, Captain. It’ll not even cut me. So,” the puppet came on, “wail away.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran raised the weapon, a wave of despair coming over him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Hairlock stopped and cocked his head. He whirled to face the north.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Impossible!” the puppet snarled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Now Paran caught what Hairlock had already heard: the howling of Hounds.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">In the hut Quick Ben had watched the ambush, dumbfounded. What was Paran doing? Where was Tattersail? “Hood’s Path,” he’d whispered angrily, “talk about losing track!” In any case, it had all happened too fast for him to prevent the loss of the one-eyed man accompanying the captain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">His eyes flew open and he snatched the scrap of cloth. “Sorry,” he hissed. “Sorry! Hear me, woman! I know you. I know who you are. Cotillion, Patron of Assassins, the Rope, I call upon you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He felt a presence enter his mind, followed by a man’s voice. “Well done, Quick Ben.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The wizard said, “I have a message for you, Rope. For Shadowthrone.” He felt a heightened tension in his head. “A deal’s been struck. Your lord’s Hounds hunger for vengeance. I haven’t time to explain it all now—leave that to Shadowthrone. I am about to give to you the location of the one Shadowthrone seeks.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He heard wry amusement in the Rope’s voice. “I provide the link, correct? The means by which you stay alive in all this. I congratulate you, Quick Ben. <a class="calibre3"></a>Few mortals have ever succeeded in avoiding my lord’s inclination to double-cross. It seems you have outwitted him. Very well, convey to me this location. Shadowthrone will receive it immediately.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Quick Ben cast forth Hairlock’s precise position on the Rhivi Plain. He only hoped the Hounds would arrive in time. He had a lot of questions for Paran, and wanted the captain to reach them alive, but he had to admit that the chances of that were slight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">All that remained for the wizard now was to prevent the puppet’s escape. He smiled again. That was something he looked forward to.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Onos T’oolan had squatted before the standing stone since dawn. In the hours since, Lorn had wandered the nearby hills, at war with herself. She now knew with a certainty that what they were doing was wrong, that its consequences went far beyond the petty efforts of a mundane Empire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The T’lan Imass worked in the span of millennia, their purposes their own. Yet their endless war had become her endless war. Laseen’s Empire was a shadow of the First Empire. The difference lay in that the Imass conducted genocide against another species. Malaz killed its own. Humanity had not climbed up since the dark age of the Imass: it had spiraled down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The sun stood high overhead. She had last looked upon Tool an hour past. The warrior had not moved an inch. Lorn climbed yet another hill, already a quarter-mile distant from the standing stone. She hoped to catch a glimpse of Lake Azur, to the west.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">She came to the hill’s summit and found herself not thirty feet from four mounted travelers. It was hard to determine who was more surprised, but the Adjunct moved first, her sword rasping into her hands as she sprang to close the distance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Two were essentially unarmed, a boy and a short fat man. They and one other, a gaudily dressed man now unsheathing a dueling rapier, rode mules. But it was the last man who held Lorn’s attention. Fully armored astride a horse, he was the first to react to her charge. Bellowing, he spurred his mount past the others and unsheathed a bastard sword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Lorn smiled as the fat man attempted to open a Warren and failed. Her Otataral blade steamed briefly before a cold wash of air poured from it. The fat man, his eyes widening, reeled back in his saddle and promptly rolled over the mule’s rump, landing heavily in the dust. The boy leaped down from his own mount and paused, unsure whether to aid the fat man or remove the dagger from his belt. As the armored man rode past him, he reached his decision and ran to where the fat man had fallen. The one with the rapier had also dismounted and approached in the warrior’s wake.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Lorn’s eyes caught all this between blinks. Then the warrior was upon her, swinging his bastard sword one-handed down toward her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Adjunct didn’t bother to parry. Instead, she dodged in front of the horse to come up on the man from his left, away from his sword arm. The horse <a class="calibre3"></a>reared. Lorn darted past, slicing her blade across the man’s thigh, above the plate armor. The Otataral edge sliced through chain links, leather, and flesh with equal ease.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The warrior grunted and clapped a mailed hand to the spurting wound even as the horse threw him from the saddle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Ignoring him, Lorn engaged the duelist, attempting to beat his thin blade aside and close to bring the edge of her weapon into play. But the man was good, deftly disengaging her attempted beat. The sword’s swing unbalanced her before she could slow its momentum preparatory to an uppercut, and in this moment the duelist extended his rapier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">She cursed as her forward motion brought her onto the blade’s tip. The point pushed through the links of her hauberk and entered her left shoulder. Pain lanced like fire up her arm. Angered by the wound, she swung her sword savagely at the man’s head. The flat of the blade caught him flush on the forehead and he sprawled back like a limp doll.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Lorn cast a quick glance to where the warrior still struggled to stop the blood gushing from his leg, then whirled to face the last two men. The boy stood before the fat man, who lay unconscious. Though his face was pale, he held a thin-bladed dagger in his left hand and a larger knife in the other. His eyes were hard as he stared at her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The thought crossed Lorn’s mind, belatedly, that she need not have attacked these men. She wore mercenary garb, and the T’lan Imass was not even within sight. Words might have achieved the same results, and she’d never liked shedding blood. Well, it was too late for that now. She advanced slowly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“We meant no harm,” the boy said in Daru. “Leave us be.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Lorn hesitated. The suggestion surprised her. Why not? She straightened. “Agreed,” she answered in the same language. “Patch up your friends and steer clear.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“We’ll head back to Darujhistan,” the boy said, looking equally surprised. “We’ll camp here and recover, leave in the morning.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Adjunct stepped back. “Do that, and you’ll stay alive. Try anything else, and I’ll kill you all. Understood?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The boy nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Lorn backed away, angling to the north. She’d head that way for a time, then swing round to the east and come back down to where Tool was. She had no idea what had brought these men out into the hills, but didn’t suspect it had anything to do with her, or even the barrow. As she increased the distance between herself and the hill, she saw the boy rush over to the warrior. In any case, she concluded, there wasn’t much left of that group to cause her worry. The duelist wasn’t dead, but he’d awake to a headache. As for the warrior, it was touch and go. She’d seen a lot of blood come from him. The fat man might have broken his neck, and as a mage he was harmless in her vicinity. That left the boy, and since when had she had cause to fear a boy?</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Lorn quickened her pace.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre7">______</span></p><div class="calibre5"> </div>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>After the startling communication from Quick Ben, Sorry had contacted Shadowthrone. The Lord of Shadows had fumed briefly, and after informing the Rope that Ben Adaephon Delat had been a high priest of Shadow, Sorry found herself sharing Shadowthrone’s anger. The man would pay for his many deceits.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Shadowthrone’s Hounds had indeed been ready, and she was sure that even now they closed the hunt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">As she resumed her journey through her Warren she met with increasing resistance, a strange pressure with every step she took eastward. Finally, she relented and emerged into the Gadrobi Hills. It was midday, and half a mile ahead rode the Coin Bearer’s party. She closed the gap swiftly until she was no more than a hundred yards behind them, gathering shadows about her as she went—though even this proved increasingly difficult. And that could mean only one thing: a T’lan Imass was nearby.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">To what, and to whom, was the Coin Bearer riding? Had she miscalculated entirely? Were they agents for the Malazan Empire? That possibility ran contrary to Oponn’s influence, but she had trouble arriving at any other conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">This, she told herself, would prove an interesting day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The party was fifty yards ahead, making their way up a hillside. They reached the summit and disappeared briefly from her view. She quickened her pace, only to hear sounds of fighting on the hilltop—a fight in which Otataral was unveiled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A flash of rage ran through her. Memory was attached to Otataral, a very personal memory. Cautiously she sought a vantage point at the hill’s crest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The exchange had been short, and the Coin Bearer’s party looked near wiped out. In fact, only the Coin Bearer still stood, facing a tall, lithe woman wielding an Otataral blade.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Sorry recognized Adjunct Lorn. On a mission, no doubt, for her dear Empress, a mission that included a T’lan Imass, still out of sight but close. She caught their conversation. If the boy’s group weren’t agents for the Empire then perhaps their master in Darujhistan had sensed the presence of the Imass out here, and had sent them to investigate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">She would discover the nature of the Adjunct’s mission later. Right now, however, it was time to kill the Coin Bearer. And the near proximity of the Imass made success all the more certain. Even Oponn’s powers could not overcome the influence of a Tellann Warren. Murdering the boy would be easy. Sorry waited, then smiled as Adjunct Lorn withdrew, heading north.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">In minutes, the Coin of Oponn would be in her hands. And this day, a god might die.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">As soon as Lorn was sufficiently distant Crokus ran to the warrior. Sorry rose slowly into a crouch, then moved forward in silence, her garotte in her hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre7">______</span></p><div class="calibre5"> </div>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>The Hounds howled again, their eager cries closing in from all sides. Hairlock crouched, indecisive. Then the puppet faced the captain. “You’ll have to wait a little longer to die, Captain. I’ve no intention of allowing things to be rushed. No, I wish to linger over your demise.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Chance sweaty in his hands, Paran shrugged. To his own surprise, it made little difference to him. If the Hounds arrived to find Hairlock gone, they’d probably take out their frustration on him, and that would be that. “You’ll come to regret the opportunity, Hairlock. Whether this sword’s magic is meant for you or not, I was looking forward to chopping you into kindling. Is your magic a match for my hatred? It would have been nice to find out.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Oh, sudden bravery! What do you know of hatred, Captain? When I return I’ll show you precisely what hatred can achieve.” The wooden figure gestured and a dozen feet away another tear opened in the air, this one exuding a fetid stench. “Stubborn mutts,” Hairlock muttered. “Until later, Captain,” and he scurried for the rent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">In the hut, Quick Ben’s grin turned savage. He jerked the dagger free with his right hand and, in a single, fluid motion, sliced the taut strings connecting the sticks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Goodbye, Hairlock,” he hissed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Paran’s eyes widened as the puppet flopped onto his stomach. A moment later Hairlock let loose a shriek.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The captain’s eyes narrowed. “Looks like somebody cut your strings, Hair-lock,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Hounds were close. In moments they’d be all over them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Your life, Captain!” Hairlock cried. “Fling me into the Warren and your life is yours, I swear it!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran leaned on his sword and made no reply.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Pawn of Oponn,” Hairlock snarled, “I would spit on you if I could! Spit on your soul!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The earth rumbled, and at once massive shapes moved around Paran, silently closing in on the immobile marionette. Paran recognized Gear, the Hound he’d wounded. He felt the sword in his hands answer that challenge with an eager tremor that reached into his arms. Gear’s head swung in his direction as it passed, and Paran saw a promise in its eyes. The captain smiled. <em class="calibre11">If anything draws Oponn out, it will be the fight to come</em>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Hairlock shrieked one last time, and then the Hounds were upon him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A large shadow passed across the hill and Paran looked up to see a Great Raven swooping over them. The bird cawed hungrily. “Too bad,” Paran said to it. “I doubt its remains would be palatable.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Three Hounds began fighting over the splintered wood—all that was left of Hairlock. The remaining four, led by Gear, now turned to Paran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>The captain raised his sword and dropped into a combative crouch. “Come on, then. Through me to the god using me, just once let the tool turn in the Twins’ hands. Come on, Hounds, let us soak this ground with blood.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The creatures fanned out into a half-circle, Gear in the center.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran’s smile broadened. <em class="calibre11">Come to me, Gear. I’m tired of being used and death doesn’t seem so frightening anymore. Let’s be done with it</em>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Something heavy pressed down on him, as if a hand had reached down from the sky and tried to drive him into the earth. The Hounds flinched. Paran staggered, unable to breathe, a sudden darkness closing around the edges of his vision. The ground groaned beneath him, the yellowed grasses of the plain lying flat. Then the pressure lifted and chilled air flooded back into his lungs. Sensing a presence, the captain whirled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Step aside,” a tall, black-skinned, white-haired man said, as he pushed past to confront the Hounds. Paran almost dropped his sword. A Tiste Andii?</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The man wore a massive two-handed sword strapped to his back. He stood before the Hounds, making no move toward the weapon. All seven had now arrayed themselves before them, but they shifted restlessly, warily eyeing the newcomer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Tiste Andii glanced at Paran. “Whatever you’ve done to draw the attention of gods, it was unwise,” he said, in Malazan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“It seems I never learn,” Paran replied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Tiste Andii smiled. “Then we are much alike, mortal.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><em class="calibre11">Mortal?</em></span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Hounds paced back and forth, growling and snapping the air. The Tiste Andii watched them, then spoke. “Enough meddling. I see you, Rood,” he said to one Hound, mangy brown, scarred, and yellow-eyed. “Take your kin and leave. Tell Shadowthrone I won’t tolerate his interference. My battle with Malaz is my own. Darujhistan is not for him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rood was the only Hound not growling. Its glowing eyes bore steadily into the Tiste Andii’s.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You have heard my warning, Rood.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran watched as the Tiste Andii cocked his head. Slowly he returned his attention to the captain. “Gear wishes you dead.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“It’s the price I pay for showing mercy.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Tiste Andii raised an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran shrugged. “See the scar he carries?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“That was your mistake, mortal. You must finish what you set out to do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Next time. What happens now?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“For the moment, mortal, they find the thought of killing me more desirable than that of killing you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“And what are their chances?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“The answer to that is evident in how long they’ve been hesitating, wouldn’t you think, mortal?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Hounds attacked faster than anything Paran could have imagined. His heart lurched as a flurry of motion closed in around the other man. As the captain <a class="calibre3"></a>stepped back an invisible fist of darkness exploded behind his eyes, a snapping of massive chains, the groan of huge wooden wheels. He squeezed shut his eyes against the staggering pain, then forced them open again to see that the fight was over. The Tiste Andii had his sword in his hands, its black blade slick with blood—blood that boiled and swiftly became ash. Two Hounds lay unmoving, one to either side of him. A wayward wind drew a wintry breath across the scene with a sound like a gasp, shivering the grasses.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran saw that one Hound had been nearly decapitated, while the other had been sliced across its broad chest—it did not look like a killing wound, but the creature’s eyes, one blue the other yellow, stared sightlessly skyward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rood yelped and the others backed away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran tasted blood in his mouth. He spat, then raised a hand to find blood trickling from his ears. The pain in his head was ebbing. He looked up just as the Tiste Andii’s head came round to face him. Seeing death in the man’s eyes, Paran stepped back and half raised his sword, though the effort took all his strength. He watched, uncomprehending, as the Tiste Andii shook his head. “For a moment I thought . . . No, I see nothing now . . .”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran blinked stinging tears from his eyes, then wiped his cheeks. He started on seeing that the stain of those tears on his forearm was pink. “You just killed two Hounds of Shadow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“The others withdrew.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Who are you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Tiste Andii did not answer, his attention once more on the Hounds.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Behind them a cloud of shadow was forming in the air, deepening and thickening in its center. A moment later it dissipated, and a black, shrouded, translucent figure stood in its place, hands tucked into its sleeves. Shadows commanded whatever face lay hidden beneath the hood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Tiste Andii lowered his sword’s point to the ground. “They were warned, Shadowthrone. I want one thing understood. You may prove my match here, especially if your Rope is about. But I promise you, it will be messy, and there are those who will avenge me. Your existence, Shadowthrone, could become uncomfortable. Now, I’ve yet to lose my temper. Withdraw your Realm’s influence from the proceedings, and I will leave it at that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I am not involved,” Shadowthrone said quietly. “My Hounds found the quarry I sought. The hunt is over.” The god’s head tilted to observe the two dead creatures. “Over for all time, for Doan and Ganrod.” Shadowthrone looked up. “There is no release for them?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“None. Nor for any who would pursue vengeance.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A sigh issued from the hooded darkness of the god’s face. “Ah, well. As I said, I am not involved. However, the Rope is.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Recall him,” the Tiste Andii commanded. “Now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“He will be severely displeased, Anomander Rake. His plans extend far beyond Darujhistan, seeking to reach the Malazan throne itself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><em class="calibre11">Anomander Rake</em> . . . Paran recalled Tattersail’s convictions after scrying her <a class="calibre3"></a>Deck of Dragons. <em class="calibre11">The Knight of High House Dark, the Son of Darkness, the lord with the black sword and its deadly chains. Ruler of Moon’s Spawn, or so she thought. She saw this coming. This very moment, the clash between Shadow and Dark, the blood spilled</em> . . .</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I fight my own battles,” Rake growled. “And I’d rather deal with Laseen on the Malazan throne than with a servant of Shadow. Recall him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“One last point,” Shadowthrone said, a giggle escaping him, “I am not responsible for whatever actions the Rope might take against you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A smile entered Rake’s tone. “Convince him of the wise course, Shadowthrone. I have no patience for your games. If I am pushed, by either you, your Hounds, or by the Rope, I’ll make no distinction. I will assail the Shadow Realm, and you are invited to try to stop me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You lack all subtlety,” the god said, sighing. “Very well.” He paused and shadows swirled around him. “He has been recalled. Forcibly extracted, as it were. The field is yours once again, Anomander Rake. The Malazan Empire is all yours, as is Oponn,” Shadowthrone added.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Oponn?” Rake’s head turned slowly, and the captain once again looked into eyes of deep, cold blue. Paran’s spirits sank. The Tiste Andii’s gaze fell to the sword, then again to Shadowthrone. “Begone,” Rake said. “The matter is ended.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Shadowthrone dipped his head. “For now.” The god raised his hands and shadows gathered around him. The surviving Hounds closed in, leaving their dead kin where they lay. The shadows thickened, became opaque, entirely hiding those within. When they dispersed, the lord and his Hounds were gone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran eyed the Tiste Andii who now faced him. After a moment the captain shrugged.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rake’s brows rose. “That’s it?” he asked. “That’s the extent of your comments? Do I speak with Oponn directly? I thought I sensed a presence before, but when I looked more carefully . . . nothing.” Rake shifted grip on his sword, the point rising. “Do you hide within, Oponn?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Not as far as I’m aware,” Paran replied. “Apparently Oponn saved my life or, rather, brought me back to life. I’ve no idea why, but I’ve been told that I’ve become Oponn’s tool.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You are journeying to Darujhistan?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“May I approach?” Rake asked, sheathing his sword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Why not?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Tiste Andii strode up to him and laid a hand against his chest. Paran felt nothing untoward. Rake stepped back. “Oponn may have been within you in the past, but it seems the Twins have hastily withdrawn. I see their signs, but no god controls you now, mortal.” He hesitated. “Their treatment of you was . . . unkind. If Caladan Brood was here he could heal that . . . You’re no longer Oponn’s tool.” The Tiste’s eyes remained blue, but they’d lightened to the color of the sky. “But your sword is.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>There was a squawk nearby and both turned to see a Great Raven alight on one of the Hound’s bodies. It plucked out an eye and gobbled it down. Paran fought back a wave of nausea. The huge battered bird hopped toward them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“This man’s sword, Master,” the raven said, “is not Oponn’s only tool, I’m afraid.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran shook his head, his only surprise the realization that nothing surprised him anymore. He sheathed his sword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Speak on, Crone,” Rake commanded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The raven cocked its head at Paran. “Here, Master?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rake frowned. “Perhaps not.” He faced the captain again. “Hold on to that weapon until your luck turns. When that happens, and if you’re still alive, break it or give it to your worst enemy.” A grin crossed his features. “Thus far, it seems your luck holds.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran hesitated. “I’m free to go?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Lord Anomander Rake nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The captain looked around, then strode off in search of the surviving horses.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Minutes later, the shock came to Paran, driving him to his knees. Toc was gone. He’d dragged the man with him in his relentless, mindless pursuit across the plain. He looked up, eyes unseeing. He’d called Hairlock his enemy. He’d proclaimed Lorn’s death his final goal. As if these two things would answer the anguish within him, would heal the pain of loss. <em class="calibre11">But the demon is within me</em>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Oponn had been unkind . . . What had Rake meant? <em class="calibre11">Have any of these thoughts been my own? Look at me—my every move seems a desperate search for someone to blame, always someone else. I’ve made being a tool of a god an excuse, a justification for not thinking, for simply reacting. And others have died for it</em>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Rake had also said, “Finish what you start.” He would have to deal with his own demons later. There could be no turning back. But it had been wrong to think that what he planned would end the pain within him. Adding Lorn’s blood to his stained hands would not achieve what he sought.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran rose, collected the reins of the surviving horses. He led the beasts back to the scene of the fight. The Tiste Andii had vanished, but the Hounds remained, motionless dark humps in the yellow grass. He dropped the reins and approached one. The slice across its chest still leaked blood. Crouching, Paran reached out, ran his fingers along the animal’s hide. <em class="calibre11">See what the desire for murder gets you? Hood’s Breath, but you were a beautiful beast</em>. His fingertips brushed blood. The captain recoiled at the contact, but it was too late. Something rippled up his arm, swept through him. He fell back into darkness, the sound of chains rattling taut.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran found himself walking and he was not alone. Through the gloom he could make out figures on all sides, each shackled with long iron chains, leaning forward as if pulling at an immense weight. The ground underfoot was barren, lifeless. Overhead there was nothing but darkness. Beneath the constant creak of <a class="calibre3"></a>the chains was a heavier sound that Paran could feel through the soles of his boots. Alone unchained, he fell back toward the source of that sound, passing chained figures, many of them not human. A shape appeared, hulking, pitching. A wagon, impossibly huge, its wooden wheels taller than a man. Driven by an insatiable desire to discover what it carried, Paran moved closer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A chain ripped across his chest, throwing him from his feet. An ear-piercing howl sounded directly above him. Claws gouged his left arm, pinning it to the ground. A chain rippled under his back. He struggled as a cold wet nose and savage teeth pushed under his chin. The jaws opened, slipped around his neck, then tightened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran lay perfectly still, waiting for the fatal clenching of those jaws. Instead, they pulled away. He found himself staring up into the Hound’s eyes, one blue, one brown. A massive collar of iron circled its neck. The beast lunged away. The chain under him snapped taut, flinging Paran into the air. He felt more than heard the wagon groan sideways, even as he landed sprawling into the path of one of the wooden wheels.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A hand grasped the collar of his cloak and dragged him clear. The captain scrambled to his feet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A voice beside him spoke. “Any man who has earned mercy from Hounds and walks here unchained is a man worth talking to. Walk with me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The shadow of a cowl hid the stranger’s features. The man was big, dressed in rags. After releasing Paran he resumed straining on his chain. “Never before,” he grunted, “has this prison been so tested.” He hissed as the wagon lurched yet again to the Hounds’ frantic attempts to escape. “I fear this will overturn.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“And if it does?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The face swung to him briefly and in the darkness Paran saw the flash of teeth. “The pulling will get harder.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Where are we?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“The Warren within the Sword. Did not Dragnipur take your life, too?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“If it had, would I not be chained as well?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“True enough. What then are you doing here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I don’t know,” Paran admitted. “I saw the Hounds killed by Rake’s sword. Then I touched the blood of one of the slain beasts.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“That explains their confusion. They thought you one of their own . . . at first. You were wise to submit to that Hound’s challenge.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Too frightened to move, you mean.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The stranger laughed. “Even so.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“What is your name?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Names are meaningless. Rake killed me. Long ago. That is enough.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran fell silent. <em class="calibre11">Eternity, chained here, forever pulling. And I ask for the man’s name. Would any apology suffice?</em></span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The wagon bucked savagely, earth ripped from under its wheels. Figures fell, wailing. The Hounds howled their fury.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Gethol’s Breath,” the stranger gasped. “Will they never cease?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I don’t think they will,” Paran said. “Can those chains be broken?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>“No. None have managed it yet, that is, and there are dragons among us. But these Hounds . . .” He sighed. “It is astonishing, but already I long for the peace their arrival has shattered.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Perhaps I can help.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The stranger barked a laugh. “By all means, try.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran moved away, heading toward the Hounds. He had no plan in mind. <em class="calibre11">But I alone am unchained</em>. The thought stopped him and he smiled. <em class="calibre11">Unchained. No one’s tool</em>. He continued on, wondering. He passed figures straining step by step, some silent, some muttering in madness. None raised its head to glance as he passed. The sound of bestial gasping reached him. “Hounds!” Paran called. “I would help!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">After a time, they appeared from the gloom. Blood sheathed their shoulders and chests, the flesh torn and mangled by the collars. The Hounds trembled, muscles jumping along their flanks. Their eyes, level with Paran’s own, met his with such numbed, helpless misery that his heart lurched. He reached out to the odd-eyed one. “I would examine your collars, your chains, seeking a flaw.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The beast walked alongside him—they were ever moving forward, the wagon unceasing in its roll. Paran bent close, running his hands on the collar, seeking a join. There was none. Where the chain attached, the link and the collar seemed of one solid piece. Though he knew little of smithing, he believed this attachment would prove the weakest element and should already show signs of strain. But his fingertips told him otherwise. The iron was not even scratched.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran ran his hand along the chain, leaving the Hound’s side. He paused, noticing the other beast watching his every move, then continued on. From the animal to the wagon, over seventy armspans of length, he ran his hands from link to link, seeking a change in the feel of the iron, seeking heat, gouges. <em class="calibre11">Nothing</em>. He arrived alongside the wagon. The wheel he walked behind was solid wood, a span in width, nicked and gouged but otherwise featureless. The wall of the bed was twenty or more feet high. The slatted sideboards of withered, bone-gray wood showed spaces a finger’s width between. Paran flinched back on seeing skeletal fingers crowding the cracks, wriggling helplessly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The wagon’s frame beneath the sideboards drew his attention. Here the wood was black, glistening with pitch. Chain-ends entered it, countless in number, sinking seamlessly into the wood. Under his touch the frame seemed solid, yet it was as if the chain links passed through it—whatever held them, then, was beyond the wagon’s frame. Paran drew a deep breath of the cool, stale air, then ducked under the bed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The frame’s beam was a dozen spans thick, condensation dripping down from its pitched underside in endless rain. At the inside edge Paran found once again the chains, continuing on farther under the wagon. Grasping one, he followed it inward. The links grew colder as did the air around him. Before long he was forced to release the chain, his hands burned by the cold. The rain from the underside of the wagon came down as slivers of ice. Two paces ahead, the chains converged, swallowed by a suspended pool of absolute darkness. Cold poured from it in pulsing waves. Paran could get no closer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>He hissed in frustration as he scrambled along opposite the dark hole, wondering what to do next. Even if he managed to break a chain, he had no idea which ones belonged to the Hounds. As for the others . . . Anomander Rake seemed a creature of clear—if cold—justice. To break a chain could unleash ancient horrors upon the realms of the living. Even the stranger he’d spoken with could once have been a Tyrant, a horrible dominator.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran unsheathed Chance. As the blade leaped free of the scabbard it bucked wildly in his hands. The captain grinned even as tremors of terror reached through his hands from the sword. “Oponn! Dear Twins, I call on you! <em class="calibre11">Now!</em>”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The air groaned. Paran stumbled over someone, who loosed a stream of curses. Sheathing his sword, he reached down, hand closing on brocaded cloth. He pulled the god to his feet. “Why you?” Paran demanded. “I wanted your sister.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Madness, mortal!” the male Twin snapped. “To call me here! So close to the Queen of Darkness—<em class="calibre11">here, within a god-slaying sword!</em>”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran shook him. Filled with a mindless, bestial rage, the captain <em class="calibre11">shook</em> the god. He heard the Hounds howl, and fought back a sudden desire to join his voice to their cries.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Twin, terror in his bright eyes, clawed at Paran. “What—what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran stopped, his attention drawn to two chains that had gone slack. “They’re coming.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The wagon seemed to leap upward, rocked as it had never been before. The thunder of the impact filled the air, wood and ice cascading down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“They have your scent, Twin.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The god shrieked, battered his fists into Paran’s face, scratching, kicking, but the captain held on. “Not the luck that pulls.” He spat blood. “The luck . . . that pushes—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The wagon was hammered again, its wheels bucking into the air to come down with a splintering, echoing concussion. Paran had no time to wonder at the savage strength that coursed through him, a strength sufficient to hold down a god gripped in panic. He simply held on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Please!” the Twin begged. “Anything! Just ask it! Anything within my powers.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“The Hounds’ chains,” Paran said. “Break them.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I—I cannot!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The wagon shuddered sickeningly, distant wood splintering. Paran dragged the Twin a pace as it rolled forward again. “Think of a way,” he said. “Or the Hounds will have you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I—I cannot be sure, Paran.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“What? You can’t be sure of what?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Twin gestured toward the blackness. “In there. The chains are held in place within it—within the Warren of Darkness, within Kurald Galain. Should they enter . . . Idonot know—I cannot be certain, but the chains may disappear.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“How can they enter?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“They could be leaving one nightmare only to enter another.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>“It cannot be worse, Twin. I asked you, how?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Bait.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“What?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Twin smiled shakily. “As you said, they’re coming. But, Paran, you must release me. By all means, hold me before the portal, but please, at the last moment . . .”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I release my hold on you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The god nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Very well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Hounds struck the wagon again, and this time they broke through. Clutching the Twin, Paran spun round to see the beasts charging out of the gloom. His captive shrieked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The Hounds leaped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran released the god, dropping flat to the ground as the Hounds passed through the air above. The Twin vanished. The Hounds flashed past, disappeared into the portal in silence, and were gone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran rolled to his feet, even as darkness reached out for him, not with the cold of oblivion but with a breath like warm, sighing wind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He opened his eyes to find himself on his hands and knees on the plain’s yellowed grass, beside a flattened, blood-smeared patch where the body of a Hound had once lain. Insects buzzed close by. His head aching, Paran climbed to his feet. The other Hound’s body was gone as well. What had he done? And why? Of all the things that the Twin could have offered him . . . <em class="calibre11">Tattersail . . . Toc the Younger</em> . . . Then again, to pluck a soul back through Hood’s Gate was not likely within Oponn’s power to achieve. Had he freed the Hounds? He realized he would probably never know.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He staggered over to the horses. At least, for a short time there, he had been unchained. He had been free, and what he had done he had done by his own choice. <em class="calibre11">My own choice</em>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He looked to the south. <em class="calibre11">Darujhistan and the Adjunct await me. Finish what you started, Paran. Finish it once and for all</em>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">“Damn inconvenient,” Coll growled as Crokus completed tying the bandage. “She was good,” he added. “She knew exactly what to do. I’d say she’d been trained. Sort of fits, since she was dressed like a mercenary.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I still don’t understand,” Crokus said, sitting back on his haunches. He glanced at Murillio and Kruppe. Both remained unconscious. “Why did she attack us? And why didn’t she kill me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Coll did not reply. He sat glaring at his horse, which stood a dozen feet away, quietly cropping grass. He’d already voiced a dozen foul curses at the beast, and Crokus suspected that their relationship had been, as Kruppe would put it, irretrievably compromised.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“What’s this?” Coll grunted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>Crokus realized that the man was looking past the horse, a frown deepening the lines of his forehead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The boy turned, then let out a wild shout, springing backward and snatching at his daggers. His boot caught a stone and he sprawled. He jumped to his feet, one blade freed and in his hand. “It’s her!” he yelled. “The woman from the bar! She’s a killer, Coll.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Easy, lad,” Coll said. “She looks anything but dangerous, despite that sword on her hip. Hell,” he added, pushing himself straighter, “if anything, she looks completely lost.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus stared at the woman, who stood at the summit’s edge. “Hood’s Breath,” he muttered. Coll was right. He’d never seen anyone look so bewildered, so utterly at a loss. She was looking at them, tensed as if ready to flee. All the poise, the deadly confidence she’d possessed in the Phoenix Inn, was gone, as if it had never been. Crokus sheathed his dagger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“So,” he asked, “what do we do now, Coll?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The wounded man shrugged. “Ease the girl’s mind, I guess. From the looks of it, she needs some help.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“But she killed Chert,” Crokus stated. “I saw the blood on her knife.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Coll squinted at the girl. “I don’t doubt you, boy, but this girl doesn’t look capable of killing anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You think I can’t see that?” Crokus said. “I’m just telling you what I saw. I know it doesn’t make any sense!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Coll sighed. “Anyway, she still needs our help. So go and get her, Crokus.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The boy threw up his hands. “How do I do that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Damned if I know,” Coll replied, grinning. “Try flirting.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus threw the man a disgusted look, then he walked cautiously toward the girl. She tensed and backed a step. “Careful!” Crokus cried, pointing at the summit’s crest behind her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The girl saw that she stood at the very edge of a steep slope. Oddly enough, this seemed to relax her. She moved a few steps closer to Crokus, her wide eyes searching his.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“That’s right,” Crokus murmured. “Everything’s fine. Do you understand?” He pointed at his mouth and made talking motions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Coll groaned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The girl surprised them both by replying in Daru, “I understand you,” she said haltingly. “More now. You’re not Malazan, you’re not speaking Malazan. But I understand you.” She frowned. “How?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Malazan, huh?” Coll said. “Where are you from, girl?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">She thought for a moment. “Itko Kan,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“What?” Coll laughed. “What storm blew you here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Realization flooded her eyes. “Where’s my father? What happened to the nets? I bought the twine, and there was that Seer—Riggalai the Seer, the wax-witch. I remember her—she died!” The girl fell to her knees. “She died. And then—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>Coll’s expression was severe, thoughtful. “And then?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I don’t remember,” the girl whispered, looking down at her hands. “I don’t remember anything more.” She began to cry.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Gedderone’s thousand teats,” Coll cursed quietly, waving Crokus to his side. “Listen carefully, lad. Don’t wait for us. Take this girl to your uncle. Take her to Mammot, and quickly.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus scowled. “Why? I can’t just leave you here, Coll. Who knows when Murillio and Kruppe will come around? What if that mercenary comes back?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“What if she does?” Coll asked pointedly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus flushed and looked away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Murillio’s a tough bastard, despite the perfume,” Coll said. “He’ll be up and dancing in no time. Take the girl to your uncle, lad. Do as I say.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You still haven’t told me why,” Crokus said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“It’s a hunch, no more.” Coll reached up and gripped the boy’s shoulder. “This girl’s been possessed. I think. Someone, something, brought her here, to Darujhistan, and on to our trail. The truth is somewhere in her head, Crokus, and it could be vital. Your uncle knows the right people, they can help her, lad. Now, saddle up my horse. I’ll wait here for our friends to wake. Hood knows, I can’t walk anyway. I shouldn’t move for at least a couple of days. Kruppe and Murillio will handle things here. Go!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus eyed the weeping girl. Then he said. “All right, Coll. We’ll go back, me and her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Good,” Coll grunted. “Now, lay me out a bedroll and some food. Then ride on out of here, and if that damn horse of mine has a heart attack outside the city gates, even better. Hop to it, lad.”</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_68"></div></body>
