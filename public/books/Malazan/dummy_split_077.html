<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>The sun lit the morning mists into a shield of white over the lake. Down on the beach a fisher-boat rocked in the freshening waves. Unmoored, it was moments before pulling free of the pebbles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Mallet helped Whiskeyjack to a dome of rock above the beach, where they sat. The healer’s gaze hesitated on the figure of Quick Ben, standing with shoulders hunched and staring across the lake. He followed the wizard’s gaze. Moon’s Spawn hung low on the horizon, a gold cast to its ravaged basalt. Mallet grunted. “It’s heading south. I wonder what that means?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Whiskeyjack squinted against the glare. He began to massage his temples.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“More headaches?” Mallet asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Not so bad, lately,” the grizzled man said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“It’s the leg that worries me,” the healer muttered. “I need to work on it some more, and you need to stay off it awhile.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Whiskeyjack grinned. “As soon as there’s time,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Mallet sighed. “We’ll work on it then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">From the forested slope behind them Hedge called, “They’re coming in!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The healer helped Whiskeyjack stand. “Hood knows,” he whispered. “It could’ve been a lot worse, right, Sergeant?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Whiskeyjack glared across the lake. “Three lost ain’t that bad, considering.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A pained expression crossed Mallet’s face. He said nothing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Let’s move,” Whiskeyjack growled. “Captain Paran hates tardiness. And maybe the Moranth have good news. Be a change, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">From the beach, Quick Ben watched Mallet supporting his sergeant up the slope. Was it time? he wondered. To stay alive in this business, no one could afford to let up. The best plans work inside other plans, and when it’s right to feint, feint big. Keeping the other hand hidden is the hard part.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The wizard felt a stab of regret. No, it wasn’t time. Give the old man a chance to rest. He forced himself into motion. He wouldn’t let himself look back—never a good idea. The scheme was hatched.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Whiskeyjack’s going to howl when he hears this one,” he whispered to himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">Captain Paran listened to the others on the beach below, but made no move to join them. <em class="calibre11">Not yet</em>. His brush with Ascendants seemed to have left him with a new sensitivity—or perhaps it was the Otataral sword scabbarded at his side. But he could sense her, now, already in her adolescence, plump as he knew she’d be, smiling with her heavy-lidded eyes deceptively sleepy as she studied the morning sky.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a><em class="calibre11">I will come to you</em>, he promised her. <em class="calibre11">When this Pannion Seer and his cursed holy war is crushed, I will come to you then, Tattersail</em>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><em class="calibre11">“I know.”</em></span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He stiffened. That voice in his head had not been his own. Or had it? He waited, waited for more. <em class="calibre11">Tattersail?</em> Only silence answered him. <em class="calibre11">Ah, my imagination, nothing more. To think you would call up enough of your old life, to find the feelings you once held for me, find them and feel them once again. I am a fool</em>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">He rose from his crouch at Lorn’s graveside—a mound of rocks—and brushed twigs and orange pine needles from his clothing. <em class="calibre11">Look at me now. Agent for the Adjunct once, now a soldier. Finally, a soldier</em>. Smiling, he made his way down to his squad.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><em class="calibre11">“Then I shall await the coming of a soldier.”</em></span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Paran stopped in his tracks, then, smiling, continued on. “Now that,” he whispered, “was not my imagination.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">The tradecraft hugged the southern shore, making for Dhavran and the river mouth. Kalam leaned on the gunwale, his gaze sweeping the north horizon’s ragged, snow-capped mountains. Near him stood another passenger, hardly memorable and disinclined to talk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The only voices reaching the assassin came from Apsalar and Crokus. They sounded excited, each revolving around the other in a subtle dance that was yet to find its accompanying words. A slow, half smile quirked Kalam’s mouth. It’d been a long time since he’d heard such innocence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A moment later, Crokus appeared beside him, his uncle’s demon familiar clutching his shoulder. “Coll says that the Empire’s capital, Unta, is as big as Darujhistan. Is it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kalam shrugged. “Maybe. A lot uglier. I don’t expect we’ll have a chance to visit it, though. Itko Kan lies on the south coast, while Unta is on Kartool Bay, the northeast coast. Miss Darujhistan already?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">An expression of regret came over Crokus’s face. He stared down into the waves. “Just some people there,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The assassin grunted. “Know how you feel, Crokus. Hood’s Breath, look at Fiddler back there, mooning away as if somebody had cut off one of his arms and one of his legs.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Apsalar still can’t believe you’d go to all this trouble for her. She doesn’t remember being much liked in your squad.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Wasn’t her, though, was it? This woman here is a fishergirl from some two-copper village. And she’s a long way from home.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“She’s more than that,” Crokus muttered. He had a coin in his hand and was playing with it absently.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Kalam threw the boy a sharp look. “Really,” he said, deadpan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus nodded affably. He held up the coin and examined the face on it. “Do you believe in luck, Kalam?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>“No,” the assassin growled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Crokus grinned happily. “Me neither.” He flipped the coin into the air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">They watched it plummet into the sea, flash once, then vanish beneath the waves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">From near the bow, Circle Breaker slowly nodded to himself. The Eel would be delighted with the news, not to mention greatly relieved. Then he returned his attention to the west, and wondered what it would be like, no longer anonymous to the world.</span></p>
