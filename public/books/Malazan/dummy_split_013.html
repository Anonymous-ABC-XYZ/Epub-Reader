<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a><a class="calibre3"></a><em class="calibre11">1154th Year of Burn’s Sleep<br class="calibre4"/>96th Year of the Malazan Empire<br class="calibre4"/>The Last Year of Emperor Kellanved’s Reign</em></span></p>
<p class="calibre27"><span class="calibre7">The stains of rust seemed to map blood seas on the black, pocked surface of Mock’s Vane. A century old, it squatted on the point of an old pike that had been bolted to the outer top of the Hold’s wall. Monstrous and misshapen, it had been cold-hammered into the form of a winged demon, teeth bared in a leering grin, and was tugged and buffeted in squealing protest with every gust of wind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The winds were contrary the day columns of smoke rose over the Mouse Quarter of Malaz City. The Vane’s silence announced the sudden falling-off of the sea breeze that came clambering over the ragged walls of Mock’s Hold, then it creaked back into life as the hot, spark-scattered and smoke-filled breath of the Mouse Quarter reached across the city to sweep the promontory’s heights.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Ganoes Stabro Paran of the House of Paran stood on tiptoe to see over the merlon. Behind him rose Mock’s Hold, once capital of the Empire but now, since the mainland had been conquered, relegated once more to a Fist’s holding. To his left rose the pike and its wayward trophy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">For Ganoes, the ancient fortification overlooking the city was too familiar to be of interest. This visit was his third in as many years; he’d long ago explored the courtyard with its heaved cobblestones, the Old Keep—now a stable, its upper floor home to pigeons and swallows and bats—and the citadel where even now his father negotiated the island export tithe with the harbor officials. In the last instance, of course, a goodly portion was out of bounds, even for a son of a noble house; for it was in the citadel that the Fist had his residence, and in the inner chambers that such affairs of the Empire as concerned this island were conducted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Mock’s Hold forgotten behind him, Ganoes’ attention was on the tattered city below, and the riots that ran through the Mouse, its poorest quarter. Mock’s Hold stood atop a cliff. The higher land of the Pinnacle was reached by a switch-back staircase carved into the limestone of the cliff wall. The drop to the city below was eighty armspans or more, with the Hold’s battered wall adding still another six. The Mouse was at the city’s inland edge, an uneven spreading of hovels and overgrown tiers cut in half by the silt-heavy river that crawled toward the harbor. With most of Malaz City between Ganoes’ position and the riots, it was hard to make out any detail, beyond the growing pillars of black smoke.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">It was midday, but the flash and thundering concussion of magery made the air seem dark and heavy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Armor clanking, a soldier appeared along the wall near him. The man leaned vambraced forearms on the battlement, the scabbard of his longsword scraping against the stones. “Glad for your pure blood, eh?” he asked, gray eyes on the smoldering city below.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The boy studied the soldier. He already knew the complete regimental accoutrements <a class="calibre3"></a>of the Imperial Army, and the man at his side was a commander in the Third—one of the Emperor’s own, an élite. On his dark gray shoulder-cloak was a silver brooch: a bridge of stone, lit by ruby flames. <em class="calibre11">A Bridgeburner</em>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">High-ranking soldiers and officials of the Empire commonly passed through Mock’s Hold. The island of Malaz remained a vital port of call, especially now that the Korel wars to the south had begun. Ganoes had brushed shoulders with more than his share, here and in the capital, Unta.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Is it true, then?” Ganoes asked boldly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Is what true?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“The First Sword of Empire. Dassem Ultor. We heard in the capital before we left. He’s dead. Is it true? Is Dassem dead?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The man seemed to flinch, his gaze unwavering on the Mouse. “Such is war,” he muttered, under his breath, as if the words were not meant for anyone else’s ears.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You’re with the Third. I thought the Third was with him, in Seven Cities. At Y’ghatan—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Hood’s Breath, they’re still looking for his body in the still-hot rubble of that damned city, and here you are, a merchant’s son three thousand leagues from Seven Cities with information only a few are supposed to possess.” He still did not turn. “I know not your sources, but take my advice and keep what you know to yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Ganoes shrugged. “It’s said he betrayed a god.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Finally the man faced him. His face was scarred, and something that might have been a burn marred his jaw and left cheek. For all that, he looked young for a commander. “Heed the lesson there, son.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“What lesson?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Every decision you make can change the world. The best life is the one the gods don’t notice. You want to live free, boy, live quietly.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I want to be a soldier. A hero.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You’ll grow out of it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Mock’s Vane squealed as a wayward gust from the harbor cleared the grainy smoke. Ganoes could now smell rotting fish and the waterfront’s stink of humanity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Another Bridgeburner, this one with a broken, scorched fiddle strapped to his back, came up to the commander. He was wiry and if anything younger—only a few years older than Ganoes himself, who was twelve. Strange pockmarks covered his face and the backs of his hands, and his armor was a mixture of foreign accoutrements over a threadbare, stained uniform. A shortsword hung in a cracked wooden scabbard at his hip. He leaned against the merlon beside the other man with the ease of long familiarity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“It’s a bad smell when sorcerers panic,” the newcomer said. “They’re losing control down there. Hardly the need for a whole cadre of mages, just to sniff out a few wax-witches.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The commander sighed. “Thought to wait to see if they’d rein themselves in.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The soldier grunted. “They are all new, untested. This could scar some of <a class="calibre3"></a>them forever. Besides,” he added, “more than a few down there are following someone else’s orders.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“A suspicion, no more.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“The proof’s right there,” the other man said. “In the Mouse.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Perhaps.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“You’re too protective,” the man said. “Surly says it’s your greatest weakness.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Surly’s the Emperor’s concern, not mine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A second grunt answered that. “Maybe all of us before too long.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The commander was silent, slowly turning to study his companion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The man shrugged. “Just a feeling. She’s taking a new name, you know. Laseen.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Laseen?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Napan word. Means—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“I know what it means.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Hope the Emperor does, too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Ganoes said, “It means Thronemaster.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The two looked down at him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The wind shifted again, making the iron demon groan on its perch—a smell of cool stone from the Hold itself. “My tutor’s Napan,” Ganoes explained.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">A new voice spoke behind them, a woman’s, imperious and cold. “Commander.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Both soldiers turned, but without haste. The commander said to his companion, “The new company needs help down there. Send Dujek and a wing, and get some sappers to contain the fires—wouldn’t do to have the whole city burn.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The soldier nodded, marched away, sparing the woman not a single glance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">She stood with two bodyguards near the portal in the citadel’s square tower. Her dusky blue skin marked her as Napan, but she was otherwise plain, wearing a salt-stained gray robe, her mousy hair cut short like a soldier’s, her features thin and unmemorable. It was, however, her bodyguards that sent a shiver through Ganoes. They flanked her: tall, swathed in black, hands hidden in sleeves, hoods shadowing their faces. Ganoes had never seen a Claw before, but he instinctively knew these creatures to be acolytes of the cult. Which meant the woman was . . .</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The commander said, “It’s your mess, Surly. Seems I’ll have to clean it up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Ganoes was shocked at the absence of fear—the near-contempt in the soldier’s voice. Surly had created the Claw, making it a power rivaled only by the Emperor himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“That is no longer my name, Commander.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The man grimaced. “So I’ve heard. You must be feeling confident in the Emperor’s absence. He’s not the only one who remembers you as nothing more than a serving-wench down in the Old Quarter. I take it the gratitude’s washed off long since.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The woman’s face betrayed no change of expression to mark if the man’s words had stung. “The command was a simple one,” she said. “It seems your new officers are unable to cope with the task.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7"><a class="calibre3"></a>“It’s got out of hand,” the commander said. “They’re unseasoned—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Not my concern,” she snapped. “Nor am I particularly disappointed. Loss of control delivers its own lessons to those who oppose us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Oppose? A handful of minor witches selling their meager talents—to what sinister end? Finding the coraval schools on the shoals in the bay. Hood’s Breath, woman, hardly a threat to the Empire.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“Unsanctioned. Defiant of the new laws—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“<em class="calibre11">Your</em> laws, Surly. They won’t work, and when the Emperor returns he’ll quash your prohibition of sorcery, you can be certain of that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The woman smiled coldly. “You’ll be pleased to know that the Tower’s signaled the approach of the transports for your new recruits. We’ll not miss you or your restless, seditious soldiers, Commander.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Without another word, or a single glance spared for the boy standing beside the commander, she swung about and, flanked by her silent bodyguards, reentered the citadel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Ganoes and the commander returned their attention to the riot in the Mouse. Flames were visible, climbing through the smoke.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“One day I’ll be a soldier,” Ganoes said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The man grunted. “Only if you fail at all else, son. Taking up the sword is the last act of desperate men. Mark my words and find yourself a more worthy dream.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Ganoes scowled. “You’re not like the other soldiers I’ve talked to. You sound more like my father.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“But I’m not your father,” the man growled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">“The world,” Ganoes said, “doesn’t need another wine merchant.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The commander’s eyes narrowed, gauging. He opened his mouth to make the obvious reply, then shut it again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Ganoes Paran looked back down at the burning quarter, pleased with himself. <em class="calibre11">Even a boy, Commander, can make a point</em>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">Mock’s Vane swung once more. Hot smoke rolled over the wall, engulfing them. A reek of burning cloth, scorched paint, and stone, and now of something sweet. “An abattoir’s caught fire,” Ganoes said. “Pigs.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre39"><span class="calibre7">The commander grimaced. After a long moment he sighed and leaned back down on the merlon. “As you say, boy, as you say.”</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_18"></div></body>
